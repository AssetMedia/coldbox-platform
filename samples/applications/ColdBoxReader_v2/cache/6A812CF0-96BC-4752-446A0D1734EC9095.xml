				<title>Ask a Jedi: Bilingual Sites</title>
				<link>http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/6/19/Ask-a-Jedi-Bilingual-Sites</link>
				<description>
				
				A reader had a short and sweet question for me:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
What is the best way to create a bilingual site...english and spanish?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Like many short questions - this one is actually a quite huge topic. I'm going to answer it, but folks should be aware that I'm just scratching the surface of a more in-depth answer.

				<title>Moving from SQL Server to MySQL</title>
				<link>http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/6/17/Moving-from-SQL-Server-to-MySQL</link>
				<description>
				
				This blog post is mostly for me so I don't forget, but here is an excellent tool for migrating from SQL Server to MySQL: &lt;a href="http://www.kofler.cc/mysql/mssql2mysql.html"&gt;MSSQL2MySQL&lt;/a&gt;.  The only drawback is that you need MS Office or VB installed to run the script. I still have MS Office on my desktop, but I don't use it anymore. I'm completely on OpenOffice now. (Except on the Mac - I'm still using Office there till OpenOffice for the Mac gets improved.)

				<title>Mac and Mini Update</title>
				<link>http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/6/16/Mac-and-Mini-Update</link>
				<description>
				
				I know - it sounds like some Disney show. Let me start with the icky stuff first so I can at least end on a happy note. If you remember, I've been fighting Mini Corp to try to get a refund on what I consider to be a lemon. While I was in Detroit I got a call back from Mini Corp. (In my last entry I believe I mentioned that they called me and were "investigating". My contact at Mini, who was very polite, said that they would absolutely not consider giving me a refund. In their mind, the repairs had been made and that was that.

So - while I was in Detroit, my wife contacted a lawyer. They had some issues getting mail out, but supposedly I will be getting a packet of forms to fill out.

On Monday, Brian Harris, the shop in Baton Rouge where I got the Mini, called to say the car was done. What is interesting is that earlier in the day, I got a form letter from Mini talking about how my car had a bad battery. The kind of form letter you normally get in recall type situations. So it &lt;i&gt;wasn't&lt;/i&gt; that I wasn't driving the car enough or "bad gas". The only problem is - they had already replaced the battery. That was done on the 3rd service trip. The trip where the car returned and worked for 24 hours before breaking down again.

So now I'm just sick about it. I look at the car and my stomach just twists. If I could just sell it, I'd at least get some money back and get it out of my life, but I'm not sure how I feel selling it. On one hand, Mini says the car is fine. On the other hand, I feel like the car is cursed. 

So - to kind of wrap this up on a good note. I convinced my wife to go Mac. I ordered her a Macbook today. I got the very low end white one since all she does is use Firefox and Thunderbird. I really feel sorry for her. Her old laptop was so bad that the battery wouldn't work, and she has to hold the plugin for the AC power to even flow into the machine. Oh - and she is missing a few keys as well. 

I also ordered another gig of RAM. I absolutely love how well Parallels work, but it's a dog to start up, and I'm definitely using the Mac enough where 2 gigs makes sense. 

Today was a bit intense for me blog wise. I don't think I've written this many posts in one day ever, but hey, I figure I'm a bit too quiet in real life, so I can be verbose here.

These guys should be ashamed.

				<title>Lighthouse Pro 2.0.3</title>
				<link>http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/6/16/Lighthouse-Pro-203</link>
				<description>
				
				I've released an update to &lt;a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/lhp"&gt;Lighthouse Pro&lt;/a&gt; today. There are two main changes in this application, both of which were suggested from Dan Sorensen.

The first is the addition of announcements. Announcements are a simple way to tie things to a project like, due dates, or meeting reminders. So for example, you could add an announcement to a project reminding folks that the launch day is Saturday and the bugs need to be fixed. Thanks Dan for the idea!

The second idea was a design change to the LHP home page. When you logon, you will see a little box that shows your current open bugs. This is a handy little report and makes the home page a lot more interesting now. This was all Dan's code, so thanks go to him.

There are also a few other small fixes.

I know that updates to my projects have slowed down a bit. That is because I am working on a new project that will take a few months to complete. I'm going to try to get small updates like this out every week though so my applications don't get too stale. As always, I'll remind folks of my &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/registry/2TCL1D08EZEYE"&gt;wish list&lt;/a&gt; (hey, the purchased items list is blank now! ;) since, well, I like to do that. 

Enjoy!

				<title>Good article on computer languages and being practical</title>
				<link>http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/6/16/Good-article-on-computer-languages-and-being-practical</link>
				<description>
				
				I've never visited Nutrun before, but I absolutely loved this article: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href="http://nutrun.com/weblog/three-lines-of-code/"&gt;Three lines of code&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The article begins with a simple question and answer: How do you read a file in Java? Answer? Simple - just write a utility class!

But the author then asks - why is something so simple and basic not a part of the language? From the article:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
So how much DRY was applied to a language that requires you to wrap its File I/O routines in a utility class after all these years?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and later...

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Or maybe someone out there was disappointed when Collections were introduced in Java? Who needs them, when you can implement LinkedList yourself?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now I'm not reading this as a negative review of Java per se, but a point to the &lt;i&gt;practicality&lt;/i&gt; of language design. (Not that I pretend to be an expert!) At the 10 year anniversary party for ColdFusion, one of the creators said his intent was not to make a beautiful language, but a practical one, and I think that speaks volumes about what makes ColdFusion such a strong web development language. You can't use CF to go to the moon - or run a nuclear reactor. And that's fine. CF is absolutely wonderful and great for making web sites. Folks need to remember that when they get "attacked" by the .Net or Java folks arguing how much better their language is then ours. It's all about using what is best for the task at hand - and I have yet to see a language better for making dynamic web sites. 

The absolute best line from this article:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Trying to pinpoint what makes a language better than another is too abstract a subject for anyone to come up with any concrete suggestions anyway. However, the choice is highly dependent on the problem we?re trying to solve, and for a significant number of problems out there at the moment, there are better tools for the job than Java. And I do believe what makes a good mechanic is his judgement in terms of the choice of tools.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Amen. You can replace Java with any language, including ColdFusion. I'm sure most of my readers know this already, but I just wanted to share. Oh, and I had no idea what DRY was. Here is an article that talks a bit about it: &lt;a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/dry.html"&gt;http://www.artima.com/intv/dry.html&lt;/a&gt;.

				<title>Friday Puzzler: Finding a meeting time</title>
				<link>http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/6/16/Friday-Puzzler-Finding-a-meeting-time</link>
				<description>
				
				Here is an interesting problem, and one I admit I'm not sure what the best answer is. You have two people who want to meet. However, both are quite busy and have a day full of meetings. Can you use ColdFusion to find a time where both are available? I've created a simple data set that contains a query of 4 rows. Person ID is the FK of the user. Name is the name. Start and End are the times of a meeting. Each row then is one meeting, or a busy time. Your solution needs to find a time where users 1 and 2 can meet up (on 6/16 obviously). Your solution should only search from 8AM to 6PM, and, potentially, handle a case where a meeting is impossible. 


Here is some code that will generate the data for you. By the way - notice how I commit one of the cardinal sins of UDFs - accessing outside data from a UDF. Also notice how I don't care - it was a handy way to manipulate the core query quickly and easily. Anyway, here is the code:

&lt;code&gt;
&lt;cfscript&gt;
function addEvent(personid, name, start, end) {
	queryAddRow(data);
	querySetCell(data, "personid", arguments.personid);
	querySetCell(data, "name", arguments.name);
	querySetCell(data, "start", arguments.start);
	querySetCell(data, "end", arguments.end);
}
&lt;/cfscript&gt;

&lt;cfset data = queryNew("personid,name,start,end")&gt;
&lt;cfset addEvent(1, "Ray", "6/16/06 8:00 AM", "6/16/06 10:00 AM")&gt;
&lt;cfset addEvent(1, "Ray", "6/16/06 2:00 PM", "6/16/06 4:00 PM")&gt;
&lt;cfset addEvent(2, "Lynn", "6/16/06 8:00 AM", "6/16/06 9:00 AM")&gt;
&lt;cfset addEvent(2, "Lynn", "6/16/06 10:00 AM", "6/16/06 12:00 PM")&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

				<title>ColdFusion Security Checklist</title>
				<link>http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/6/16/ColdFusion-Security-Checklist</link>
				<description>
				
				A few days ago I &lt;a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/6/14/Top-10-PHP-Vulnerbalities"&gt;blogged&lt;/a&gt; about a list of PHP vulnerabilities and how they applied to ColdFusion users as well. With that in mind I've created a one page resource for ColdFusion users:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/coldfusionsecuritychecklist.cfm"&gt;ColdFusion Security Checklist&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If you ever forget the URL, just check the Guides pod to the right. Let me be absolutely clear on this:

Security is &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; a task item.&lt;br&gt;
Security is &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; something you can tack on at the end.&lt;br&gt;
Security is a way of life, a religion. You need to keep it in your head from the very first day a project starts until the end of the world.

So please keep the above points in mind. I made this checklist as a simple high level reminder of things to keep in mind. I can imagine a manager sharing it with his or her employees. It is not meant to be a book. 

The unfortunate thing is that even this simple list is ignored by far too many people. 

I know that some people will disagree with some of the items on the list. I've already taken some feedback from folks, but it will never make everyone happy. At the end of the day, I hope the list provides some guideposts to at least a) steer you in the right direction and more importantly b) keep security in mind as you develop.

				<title>Ask a Jedi: Coding for Review</title>
				<link>http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/6/15/Ask-a-Jedi-Coding-for-Review</link>
				<description>
				
				John asks:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I am coding ColdFusion now for over 6 years within different teams. During that time I have found it quite difficult to find the right style of coding to make it easy to review.

Is there general guideline?

Like calling a query qryQueryName or qry_QueryName or qry_queryName or queryName.

It is not about finding the perfect one, but a thought-out one I can relate to the team and this way make debugging easier.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is one of those questions that illicit a great deal of responses, so be prepared to get a wealth of opinions. Let me describe my coding style in general.

1) I use tabs instead of spaces. I hate spaces for tabs. Don't know why. I think because I use the keyboard a lot and clicking the right arrow on a tab will move faster than having to go over a set of spaces.

2) I indent all code in conditionals, wrapped tags, etc. I have a few exceptions. I don't always indent the functions of a component. I feel like I should since cffunction is a child of cfcomponent, but at the same time, it seems silly to indent them when the cfcomponent tags make up 1% of the file usually. The main reason for indentation, in my opinion, is to help remember what code belongs to blocks of conditions, loops, etc. 

3) I lower/camel case my code. So I'll do:

&lt;code&gt;
&lt;cfset x = htmlEditFormt(form.fooBar)&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

In the old days I used to capitalize all of my code. I was stupid. I admit it.

4) Variable Names: This was the main focus of your question. In the past I've done the format where the variable types are included in the name. This is called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation"&gt;Hungarian notation&lt;/a&gt;. I don't typically do it. Every now and then I'll slip and name a query something like qPeople, but in general, I don't use it. At first it seems kind of cool, but I guess I always figured if I didn't know what the variable was doing, then maybe something was wrong with my development. If you follow the link above, you will see more criticisms of the notation and I tend to agree with them.

I do believe in good variable names. So peopleList is better than pl. In fact, I'd probably say you should only use one character variables for iterators. (Again though, I've been known to cheat on this rule as well.)

At the end of the day - nothing beats documentation. I've never regretted over-documenting. On the other side, I have regretted not writing enough documentation.

				<title>Tip: Remove some, but not all, HTML</title>
				<link>http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/6/15/Tip-Remove-some-but-not-all-HTML</link>
				<description>
				
				A friend pinged me yesterday with a problem. His site allowed folks to post content with HTML, and while in general this worked fine, some users were posting content with Flash. He wanted to prevent this from being added to the content.

Now - the brute force fix is to simply htmlEditFormat() the code, but that would remove all HTML, not just the unwanted tags.

				<title>CanvasWiki Updated</title>
				<link>http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/6/15/CanvasWiki-Updated</link>
				<description>
				
				&lt;a href="http://www.thebitbucket.net/weblog/"&gt;Lucas Sherwood&lt;/a&gt; sent in a nice little modification for CanvasWiki, Google Sitemap support. I've added this and updated the build. You can download Canvas from the &lt;a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/canvas"&gt;project page&lt;/a&gt;. 

Also - over the last few days I've had a few people talk to me about Canvas. I believe I told all of them that the main feature I wanted to add was a simple notification system when someone adds/edits a page. Silly me - I forgot I had added that already. 

And lastly, on a completely unrelated note - I had gone to download Picasa today for my Mac and was sad to see it wasn't supported on the Mac yet. I had forgotten that the Mac ships with iPhoto. What a nice little application. I love the fact that you can export a slide show to Quicktime or DVD. That's pretty darn handy. I was going to complain that it's too bad that the web option is only for iLife, but I double checked and saw an export to Web Page option. Every day I love this little laptop more and more. (Now if I could just get CFE's RDS or FTP editing working...)

				<link>http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/6/14/ModelGlue-2-Beta-1-Available</link>
				<description>
				
				The title says it all. You can now get the &lt;a href="http://www.model-glue.com/index.cfm?mode=entry&amp;entry=D5815F2A-3048-55C9-432B8F55F7D81A87"&gt;beta 1&lt;/a&gt; version of Model-Glue 2. I've been playing with it already and I'm very happy with that I see so far. I'm working on a very large project in my free time (did you notice the lack of updates to my released projects) and it is using Model-Glue 2. Along with new features, Joe finally wrote some good documentation. (I think he got tired of me complaining!)

				<title>Top 10 PHP Vulnerbalities (and why ColdFusion developers need to care)</title>
				<link>http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/6/14/Top-10-PHP-Vulnerbalities</link>
				<description>
				
				I found an interesting article today via Digg:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.sklar.com/page/article/owasp-top-ten"&gt;PHP and the OWASP Top Ten Security Vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So why am I writing about PHP on a ColdFusion blog? Check the link out. It is amazing how similar the issues are to things that I, and others, have tried to teach ColdFusion developers as well. I especially like their top tip, which has been my primary recommendation for years - Unvalidated Parameters. I know I've said this before, but validating input parameters is something that is a) easy and b) done far too less. Go to a few random web sites with parameters in the URL, change them, and see how quickly the site throws an error.

				<title>Macbook Pro and Firefox tip</title>
				<link>http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/6/13/Macbook-Pro-and-Firefox-tip</link>
				<description>
				
				One thing that has been driving me crazy about this Mac (besides RDS not working) is the silly behavior of tabs in Firefox. Imagine a logon form. You click on the username field and enter your name. You hit tab and then enter the password. You hit tab again and... eh? Where did my cursor go? To the address bar. 

I don't know &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; Firefox does this, but I found a site with the answer:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href="http://sidesh0w.com/weblog/2004/09/01/tabindex_osx_firefox/"&gt;Proper tabindex in OSX Firefox&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And if you are like me, you may not know where your Firefox preferences are stored. You can find it under the Library/Application Support/Firefox/profiles folder. Not the Library folder at /, but the Library folder under your own account.

				<title>ColdFusion Cookbook hits 100!</title>
				<link>http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/6/13/ColdFusion-Cookbook-hits-100</link>

				I am &lt;b&gt;very&lt;/b&gt; happy to announce that the &lt;a href="http://www.coldfusioncookbook.com"&gt;ColdFusion Cookbook&lt;/a&gt; has hit 100 entries! While I built the site, about 90 of those 100 entries were published by &lt;a href="http://www.petersenfam.com/jeremy/"&gt;Jeremy Petersen&lt;/a&gt;. The PDF is now almost the size of a "real" book, and I think that is something to be proud of.
