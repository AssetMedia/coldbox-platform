				<description>
				
				After spending my entire career never making any of the ColdFusion/Allaire/Macromedia conferences, I am already confirmed to be attending BOTH CFObjective (March 11 &amp; 12) AND CFUnited (June 28-30). Looking forward to putting some faces with the names.

				<title>Open-Source List RSS Feed Added</title>
				<link>http://www.remotesynthesis.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/2/20/OpenSource-List-RSS-Feed-Added</link>
				<description>
				
				Just a quick note to mention that I have already gone ahead and added the RSS feed to the ColdFusion Open-Source List. You can access it by going to http://www.remotesynthesis.com/cfopensourcelist/rss.cfm. Thanks to Ray Camden, as I borrowed liberally from the RSS code in his BlogCFC. Currently I have it set to output the most recent ten entries. You can actually subscribe to just a category if you choose by appending the categoryID (though this is useful only in a few categories). Let me know if this works well as I am open to suggestions on improving it.

				<title>Open-Source Project List Relaunched</title>
				<link>http://www.remotesynthesis.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/2/20/OpenSource-Project-List-Relaunched</link>
				<description>
				
				The original  ColdFusion Open-Source Project List got alot of attention and continues to get alot of traffic. However, there were problems with it: 1) it was a pain to maintain (especially since - this is the good news - I seem to be adding new projects on a regular basis) 2) the URL was clunky.

Because of this, I built a new version that runs on Reactor (I documented the development here). This version is essentially the same as the old, but has a cleaner URL. It also adds license information (where I could reasonably determine that) and categories.  Determining categories proved to be a bit of a pain, and I am open to any better suggestions.

This isn't a finished application yet. Some of the things I would like to see added first are: 1) A seperate RSS feed just for the list that will show newly added projects 2) the ability to keyword search the list. Any other suggestions?

In case you missed the URL above it is http://www.remotesynthesis.com/cfopensourcelist. You can also access it via the "cf open source list" item in my site navigation.

As a side note, I will no longer be maintaining the older list, so please update your bookmarks.

				<title>Getting Started with Reactor</title>
				<link>http://www.remotesynthesis.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/2/17/Getting-Started-with-Reactor</link>
				<description>
				
				As I have blogged earlier, I recently got the chance to begin revisiting using Reactor as part of my application "infrastructure". Doug Hughes has done a great job of building Reactor into a powerful tool to handle all the tedium of creating your component beans, DAOs and Gateways (and Transfer Objects). This is fantastic in and of itself, but, as I have discussed, you could easily create a code generator to do this yourself (not on the fly I suppose, but it still is a major time saver). I want to cover some of the more powerful features of Reactor (and some of the basics) from the perspective of a beginner (and a nOOb).

				<title>Reactor - I am Impressed</title>
				<link>http://www.remotesynthesis.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/2/3/Reactor--I-am-Impressed</link>
				<description>
				
				It has been a long while since I last reviewed Doug Hughes' Reactor for ColdFusion. I finally had the chance to go through the documentation (which in and of itself is new, as are the sample applications that are included) and I am seriously impressed by all that has been added or improved since the 0.1 release (the version I was looking at is the 1.0 alpha). The XML configuration seems extremely straightforward and easy to maintain, and the power of the joins you can manage has dramatically improved (especially the addition of "many to many" relationships). The query objects also appear to give Reactor alot flexibility (although that portion of the documentation was still somewhat limited as of the version I was reading - but I give Doug alot of credit as the docs in their current somewhat unfinished stage still run 51 pages). I hope to give Reactor a good run-through very soon to see the current version in action, but based on what I have learned so far, I can imagine it becoming a fixture in my applications.

				<title>PCWorld: Internet Explorer 7 Now Available for Public Download</title>
				<link>http://www.remotesynthesis.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/1/31/PCWorld-Internet-Explorer-7-Now-Available-for-Public-Download</link>
				<description>
				
				This PCWorld Article announces that "the beta version of Microsoft's Internet Explorer 7 is available to the general public starting today." You can go directly to download the beta by going here. It is apparently only compatible with Windows XP Service Pack 2. The features being touted are "tabbed browsing, a toolbar-integrated search box, and limited RSS support." Hmmm...any other browsers out there that already support those? Anyway, it will be nice to have IE finally catch up on these features.

Important note - according to Microsoft: "IE7 replaces IE6. You can uninstall IE7; this will revert you back to your IE6 installation."

				<title>OT: Alito Roll-Call</title>
				<link>http://www.remotesynthesis.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/1/31/OT-Alito-RollCall</link>
				<description>
				
				I generally stay away from politics on this blog, but it has always been something I am passionate about and thus I cannot help speaking on it occassionally. Yesterday, the Senate voted to end debate on the nomination of Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court, effectively ensuring his nomination will succeed. Most Democrats have come out in opposition to the nomination, however the vote to end debate included 19 Democrats. This stikes me as playing both sides of the table. These same Democrats are likely to tout their "no" vote in the upcoming mid-term elections, banking on that you are not aware of their vote to end debate and its significance. So, in doing my part, here are a list of names of Democrats who voted in favor of Alito's nomination by choosing to end debate:

Arkansas - Lincoln (D) Yes; Pryor (D) Yes
Colorado - Salazar (D) Yes
Connecticut - Lieberman (D) Yes
Delaware - Carper (D) Yes
Florida - Nelson (D) Yes
Hawaii - Akaka (D) Yes; Inouye (D) Yes
Iowa - Harkin (D) Not Voting
Louisiana - Landrieu (D) Yes
Montana - Baucus (D) Yes
Nebraska - Nelson (D) Yes
New Mexico - Bingaman (D) Yes
North Dakota - Conrad (D) Yes; Dorgan (D) Yes
South Dakota - Johnson (D) Yes
Washington - Cantwell (D) Yes
West Virginia - Byrd (D) Yes; Rockefeller (D) Yes
Wisconsin - Kohl (D) Yes

				<title>Random Records in T-SQL</title>
				<link>http://www.remotesynthesis.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/1/30/Random-Records-in-TSQL</link>
				<description>
				
				Recently, I needed to write a simple query that would randomly grab a single product record from the database. In the past, I have used QueryRandomRows() to do this, but this can be very inefficient if you want to pull a random record from a large data set. I happened upon a solution for MS SQL that is extremely simple (this is an oversimplified version of my query):



	SELECT	TOP 1 id, productName
	FROM	products
	ORDER BY NEWID()



Obviously, you can alter how many rows you return by changing the TOP 1. Also note that using the RAND() function will not work even though it may seem more logical. This is because "repetitive calls of RAND() with the same seed value return the same results." This means that within a single query, RAND() will return the same result for every row.

I am sure I have seen this blogged elsewhere, but I cannot remember where exactly (so forgive me if this is not new).

				<title>Ray Camden Speaking at Boston CFUG</title>
				<link>http://www.remotesynthesis.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/1/25/Ray-Camden-Speaking-at-Boston-CFUG</link>
				<description>
				
				Raymond Camden has generously agreed to speak at the first meeting of the newly revived Boston ColdFusion User Group. The meeting will be on Friday February 3rd at 6:30pm (sorry about the short notice, but I wanted to take advantage of the opportunity with Ray in town next week). The location is the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, 600 Atlantic Ave. (4th floor) directly across the street from South Station. To ease security, interested attendees are asked to RSVP to me at &amp;#98;&amp;#114;&amp;#105;&amp;#110;&amp;#97;&amp;#108;&amp;#100;&amp;#105;&amp;#64;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#109;&amp;#111;&amp;#116;&amp;#101;&amp;#115;&amp;#121;&amp;#110;&amp;#116;&amp;#104;&amp;#101;&amp;#115;&amp;#105;&amp;#115;&amp;#46;&amp;#99;&amp;#111;&amp;#109; . Feel free to send topic suggestions as well.

				<title>Gaim 2 beta 2 is out</title>
				<link>http://www.remotesynthesis.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/1/24/Gaim-2-beta-2-is-out</link>
				<description>
				
				The new beta release of Gaim 2.0 is out. I used the early beta at home and while I liked some of the features, and felt it was a step forward, it was a very rough cut. However, the feedback they received leads me to believe this will be a much more refined release.

				<title>Open-Source JavaScript Effects Library</title>
				<link>http://www.remotesynthesis.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/1/20/OpenSource-JavaScript-Effects-Library</link>
				<description>
				
				I found this on the Wired news site. It's a very lightweight (3kb) JavaScript library for generating some very nice page effects (see page for examples) called moo.fx. The description from the site is the following:

moo.fx is a superlightweight, ultratiny, megasmall javascript effects library, written with prototype.js.

It's easy to use, fast, cross-browser, standards compliant, provides controls to modify Height, Width, and Opacity with builtin checks that won't let a user break the effect with multiple crazy clicks. It's also optimized to make you write the lesser code possible.

It's definitely worth checking out.
