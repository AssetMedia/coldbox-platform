			<title><![CDATA[ CFQUERY Results: Is it NULL or is it just an Empty String? ]]></title>
			<link>http://www.compoundtheory.com/?action=displayPost&amp;ID=153</link>
			<description><![CDATA[ One of the annoying things in CF is that when you query a database, all NULL values in the db actually come back as empty strings.&amp;nbsp; This means that if you actually store an empty string in the database, you have no way of knowing if it was an empty string, or a NULL value.    I hit this the other day when working on a database column where both an empty string and NULL values where valid data... ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[ Things seem to have heated up in the news for Transfer , which has been fantastic.&amp;nbsp; Huge thanks to Sean Corfield  and Matt Woodard  for their write-ups on Transfer, they are greatly appreciated.The most interesting of news is having Sean on board to write a the ORM Adapter  for Model-Glue:Unity , so that Transfer can be used in place of Reactor .&amp;nbsp; This has actually been very interesting,... ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ AsyncHTTP 0.2 Released ]]></title>
			<link>http://www.compoundtheory.com/?action=displayPost&amp;ID=147</link>
			<description><![CDATA[ Thanks to a Stefan (sorry, don&apos;t know your last name), and Rob Pilic who sent me emails about AsyncHTTP , there have been a couple of small enhancements / bug fixes made to this library.The first solved a compatibility issue with CFMX 6.1.&amp;nbsp; This has been changed, and should mean that AsyncHTTP should now work on 6.1. (Cross Fingers)The second involved some strange scenarios in which basic dat... ]]></description>

			<title><![CDATA[ AsyncHTTP - Asynchronous HTTP Requests ]]></title>
			<link>http://www.compoundtheory.com/?action=displayPost&amp;ID=137</link>
			<description><![CDATA[ I don&apos;t know how many times I&apos;ve gone looking to do asynchronous processing in ColdFusion, and come up against the myriad of hacks, workarounds and that general feeling that I want to poke my eyes out with a rusty spoon.    Now that JavaLoader  exists, integrating Java with ColdFusion becomes so ridiculously easy, it would have been relative heresy if I hadn&apos;t sat down for an afternoon and wrote a... ]]></description>

			<link>http://www.compoundtheory.com/?action=displayPost&amp;ID=132</link>
			<description><![CDATA[ Previously  we looked at doing basic CRUD operations in Transfer, and I was going to look at some of the composition options that are available, but I decided we would look at primary keys instead first.  Primary keys are an integral part of almost any database driven application, and consequently are an integral part of Transfer as well.  When a Business Object is inserted into the database, a pr... ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[ Huge changes! Massive Changes! The whole thing has been rewritten!Okay, I&apos;m lying.&amp;nbsp; The only thing I changed is that if you pass in a path to a JAR or a directory when you init() the JavaLoader, it will throw an Exception if the path doesn&apos;t exist.This is simply a useful addition for debugging purposes, especially if you are wondering why you can&apos;t load a particular class, or you are getting ... ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[ I just uploaded the example Transfer Pet Market  application to cfpetmarket .Besides changing the data management aspects to utilise Transfer, the application has stayed fairly true to its original form, and should hopefully provide a good example of some of the things that Transfer can do.Some of the new functionality in 0.5 was a result of the issues I faced while developing the pet market appli... ]]></description>
