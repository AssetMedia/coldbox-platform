		<title>FMS coding: Pending Clients before accepting a Connection</title>
		<description>I'm currently working on a video chat app using Flash Media Server and Flex. This will be version 2 of my &lt;a href="http://www.ameegos.com" target="_blank"&gt;Ameegos.com&lt;/a&gt; excercise and this time I want to add real scalability to the app. It already supports multiple rooms (which users can create) and is based around a concept of one master application instance holding a persistent SharedObject containing all the room information which each room fetches as it starts up.&lt;br&gt;
A very popular UK dating/adult site (URL on request ;-) has bought the code from me and is running a modified version of Ameegos on their site and the chat is proving popular to put it mildly. So popular in fact that a single server couldn't cope with the traffic and was frequently being brought to its knees by around 1500 concurrent video chatters.

		<title>Free UK Phone Calls, and say no to 0870</title>
		<description>Again a little off topic for the general subject matter of this site but as it's closely related to my business I think it deserves some attention. &lt;br&gt;
I've jusy come back from reading &lt;a href="http://aralbalkan.com/838" target="_blank"&gt;Aral's blog&lt;/a&gt; and he's very annoyed with Vodafone as well as Abbey National Business, two companies that have given him nothing but grief - something I can very much relate to. &lt;br&gt;
Aral pointed out that he didn't want others to call the 0870 number when canceling a Vodafone contract but use email instead. Well here's another option: check out &lt;a href="http://www.saynoto0870.com/search.php" target="_blank"&gt;www.saynoto0870.com&lt;/a&gt;, a site which lists geographical phone numbers for hundreds of UK companies. You can then ring those numbers rather than the expensive 0870 number. The site is a bit heavily laden with ads but still worth checking out.&lt;p&gt;
You can combine this with the service from &lt;a href="http://www.1899.com" target="_blank"&gt;1899.com&lt;/a&gt;, a company that offers a pre-dial number to make cheap calls. In fact so cheap that it almost looks like a scam: 0p/min (that's FREE!) for all UK landline calls and dirt cheap rates to most other countries.&lt;br&gt;
I frequently call the USA and Germany and I can do that at 1p/minute to both landline and mobiles. All that's needed is a credit card registration at 1899.com and that's it. No need to change your phone provider, simply pre-dial 1899 and you're done.&lt;p&gt;
I have used their services for over a year now and my phone bills have come down dramatically. I've changed to the cheapest BT line rental package and then make all my calls via 1899.com. They are actually cheaper than &lt;a href="http://www.skype.com/intl/en-gb/products/skypeout/" target="_blank"&gt;Skype's skypeout feature&lt;/a&gt;, cheaper than &lt;a href="http://www.vonage.co.uk/" target="_blank"&gt;Vonage&lt;/a&gt; (who really are a scam for UK users when compared to the US prices) and cheaper than &lt;a href="http://www.talktalk.co.uk/" target=
"_blank"&gt;TalkTalk&lt;/a&gt;. Give 1899 a try, you won't regret it.</description>

How did he perform this magic? By running RIAForge on a prerelease version of &lt;a href="http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Scorpio"&gt;Scorpio&lt;/a&gt; (and no, that's not usually allowed, but we love Ray, or so we'd like him to think, so he was given special permission to do so). See Ray's &lt;a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2007/1/30/Update-to-RIAForge-Today-and-a-little-secret"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; for some details, and here's an example of a &lt;a href="http://lighthousepro.riaforge.org/"&gt;project that includes screenshots&lt;/a&gt;. Incidentally, Ray is reporting some serious performance gains, but more on that in a future post.</description>

		<title>Useful Photoshop layer-handling scripts</title>
		<description>&lt;p&gt;Last week Ralf Berger, co-creator of Photoshop's Vanishing Point tool (and formerly eng. manager for LiveMotion), asked me whether Photoshop offered a way to clean up files by deleting empty layers.&amp;#160; I knew that the Layers palette fly-out menu contains a command to delete hidden layers, but not one for blowing away those with no pixel content.&amp;#160; After a nudge towards the Photoshop JavaScript guide (installed in the application folder, btw), Ralf whipped up &lt;a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/files/DeleteEmptyLayers.jsx"&gt;this script&lt;/a&gt; for deleting blank layers.&amp;#160; I'm posting it here in case it's useful. (You may want to right-click/Ctrl-click the link to download the script, then put the file into your Photoshop folder under Presets/Scripts.)&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;On a related note, 
I came across a Trevor Morris's trove of &lt;a href="http://user.fundy.net/morris/?photoshop28.shtml"&gt;handy-looking little scripts&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160; And for more PS scriptiness, including a good discussion forum, check out &lt;a href="http://www.ps-scripts.com/bb"&gt;PS-Scripts.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

		<title>HD Photo format coming to Photoshop</title>
		<description>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft &amp;amp; Adobe have been &lt;a href="http://news.com.com/Vista+to+give+HD+Photo+format+more+exposure/2100-1045_3-6153730.html"&gt;working together&lt;/a&gt; on a plug-in that will offer support for &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD_Photo"&gt;HD Photo&lt;/a&gt; (n?e WMP*--Windows Media Photo), the new Microsoft-developed imaging format, in Photoshop.&amp;#160; HD Photo offers advanced compression (both lossless &amp;amp; lossy) and improved dynamic range relative to the standard JPEG format.&amp;#160; Timing won't permit us to have support into the CS3 box, but we'll find a way to get it out there.&amp;#160; My manager Kevin Connor noted, &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;blockquote&gt;
	  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What's good about HD Photo is that it was designed specifically for digital photography, with a good understanding of how digital photography usage is evolving,&amp;quot; Connor said. &amp;quot;It will certainly take time for HD Photo to be as broadly accessible as JPEG--if it ever is quite that broad--but there can be reasons even today why a consumer might prefer to use HD Photo.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;As with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jpeg2000"&gt;JPEG2000&lt;/a&gt;, which Photoshop began supporting in 2003,  our goal is to ensure that support exists in Adobe apps ahead of customer demand.&amp;#160; That way, as images begin appearing, you'll be good to go. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*The new name is far nicer, no?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

		<title>IE7 Breaks Relative URLS</title>
		<description>My own company's site has had huge problems lately because we did not include base href tags at the correct spot in all our code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How many of you are noticing bad links, bad images, bad forms, that just do not work in IE7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially if you have a page that has search engine friendly url's.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well in order for those to work you must have the BASE Tag in a specific spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;BASE Element--Internet Explorer 7 strictly enforces the BASE element rule, as documented in the HTML 4.01 standard. We no longer allow BASE tags outside of the HEAD of the document. The standard specifies that the base element must appear within the head of the document, before any elements that refer to an external source. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which means every coldfusion page has to have a base href in it. Which can be a tad difficult, if you have different development, production, testing or q&amp;a servers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It kind of makes me wonder if this was a necessary for IE7 feature. Or if any of you have had other IE7 issues.</description>

		<title>Is a Relationship Just a Special Case of an Attribute?</title>
		<description>The interesting thing about coming down from meta-grammars is that you see that any context free grammar can be described fully in terms of just concepts and attributes of those concepts (where the attributes may be of a primitive or custom data type or may relate to another concept). So, as you start to look at the traditional OO modeling trifecta of Object, Attribute and Relationship, the question is whether we need a separate concept called relationships or if we should just model them as a special type of attribute.

		<title>A Basic Object Definition Language</title>
		<description>OK, so now we?re coming down from the lofty heights of meta-grammars and we can start to look at something that comes closer to bearing a relationship to our everyday programming. Whether you generate your applications or hand code them, somehow you need a way to describe your object model. The goal of this Object Definition Language (ODL) is to capture enough information to be able to generate the majority of most SMB web apps directly from a set of statements in the language . . .

		<title>Functional Based Pricing</title>
		<description>One of the things I am trying to do right now is to come up with a better way to price projects based on the functionality required. The question is how to come up with the quickest way to provide the closest approximation to the real cost where clients have custom requirements but often don?t want to take the time to fully describe them.

		<title>Chris Scott on Metadata and AOP</title>
		<description>Chris Scott just wrote a very cool article on &lt;a href="http://cdscott.blogspot.com/2007/01/unlocking-power-of-cf-metadata.html"&gt;unlocking the power of CF metadata&lt;/a&gt;. He shows how to implement your own custom metadata for annotations and gives an example of adding attributes to cffunction that could be read by your advice methods if you were doing AOP. The comments are worth reading too.

Some extremely cool ideas here. Anyone else doing anything interesting with CF metadata introspection?</description>

		<title>Brian Rinaldi Interview on CF Frameworks</title>
		<description>In case you haven't caught it, &lt;a href="http://cfframeworks.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/1/29/cfframeworks-Interview-with-Brian-Rinaldi"&gt;check out&lt;/a&gt; Brian being interviewed by Kola and Nick over at CF Frameworks. Oh, and after a bit of griping by Sean, you can now subscribe to the podcast which means you'll catch the other interviews they lined up when they release them - including myself supposedly talking about LightWire but really talking about a bunch of "intro to OO" kind of stuff.

I particularly enjoyed when Nick and Kola cornered Brian, asking him to rate the popular frameworks for fun, documentation and the like. Unfortunately the answers were suitably diplomatic - nice try guys!</description>

		<title>Flex/Flash Player Based VoIP Application - GizmoCall</title>
		<description>&lt;img src="http://www.impossibilities.com/blog/images/gizmocall-logo.gif" style="padding: 5px;" align="left"&gt;I just finished playing with very cool VoIP application that uses Flash/Flex to allow you make calls to any phone right from within your browser: &lt;a href="http://www.gizmocall.com/"  title="" rel='external'&gt;GizmoCall&lt;/a&gt;. The app appears to be built on the Flex framework, requires Flash 9 for the interface and audio in and out. You dial, speak and talk right through the application. You get five minutes a day of free calls to any phone line, along with unlimited free calls to users Google Talk, Windows Live, Gizmo Project and any other SIP service. You can also of course register and buy credits for more time for outgoing calls that don't qualify as free. THey also provide control over your caller-ID (allowing for some mischievousness) I tried it out and called my brother in his cell phone and the quality was great. It was really quite impressive the quality on both ends. I was using a pretty decent noise cancelling headset, a &lt;a href="http://www.plantronics.com/north_america/en_US/products/cat640035/cat1430032/prod5500015;jsessionid=JMJIVB3SDEIFOCQBGNUCFEYKAEZWSIV0"  title="" rel='external'&gt;Plantronics .Audio 550 DSP&lt;/a&gt; so that certainly helped.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The application is pretty slick in that it does require (at least on the Mac OS X side of things - haven't tried it on Windows yet) a small Preference Pane plugin that handles part of the communications with Flash and the connections. It appears that the Preference pane app becomes a local server on your machine listening on port 61280 by default, and in turn the Flex app uses the new binary socket capabilities to communicate to the local proxy of sorts and transfer data for calls between the local Flex/Flash app in your browser. I haven't investigated it too deep yet, but I am guessing that they are using the local server/proxy app as a sort of local FMS server to handle the audio coming from the microphone through Flash and back out. I'm going to have to do a little sniffing and see how its all working a bit more because its a really interesting approach they have taken. I have a fairly decent 16MB down/4MB up connection, but even so, there was no latency/lag at all in the calls I made this evening.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I've used IM for voice chats, Breeze/Acrobat, Skype and other VoIP solutions, but this one seems really interesting. I guess for me its because of the tie in with Flex/Flash and the innovative way in which they have utilized the technology to tie it all together. To me this seems like a perfect fit for an Apollo application down the road instead of a Flash/Flex and custom local app, just do it all in Apollo. Hopefully Apollo will be able to support some more advanced local OS integration to accomplish applications like this.</description>
