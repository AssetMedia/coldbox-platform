		<title><![CDATA[Abstract Syntax Tree]]></title>
		<link>http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-JavaCodeManipulation_AST/index.html</link>
		<description><![CDATA[
		The Abstract Syntax Tree is the base framework for many powerful
		tools of the Eclipse IDE, including refactoring, Quick Fix and
		Quick Assist. The Abstract Syntax Tree maps plain Java source
		code in a tree form. This tree is more convenient and reliable
		to analyse and modify programmatically than text-based source.
		This article shows how you can use the Abstract Syntax Tree for
		your own applications.

		<title><![CDATA[Extending WTP Using Project Facets]]></title>
		<link>http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-BuildingProjectFacets/tutorial.html</link>
		<description><![CDATA[
		The Faceted Project Framework allows the plug-in developer to
		think of Web Tools Platform (WTP) projects as composed of units
		of functionality, otherwise known as facets, that can be added
		and removed by the user. This tutorial walks you through an
		example of creating a couple of basic facets and in the process
		covers the majority of the framework's extension points. This
		tutorial has been written for version 1.5 of the Web Tools
		Platform.

		<link>http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-Introducing-AJDT/article.html</link>
		<description><![CDATA[
		The AspectJ Development Tools (AJDT) project is an Eclipse Tools
		project which enables the development of AspectJ applications in
		Eclipse. This article gives an overview of the capabilities of
		AJDT 1.4 for Eclipse 3.2 by describing several scenarios,
		including adding aspects to existing Java&trade; projects,
		working with aspects across multiple projects, and using the
		load-time weaving capabilities of AspectJ 5.

		<title><![CDATA[Custom Drawing Table and Tree Items]]></title>
		<link>http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-CustomDrawingTableAndTreeItems/customDraw.htm</link>
		<description><![CDATA[
		Populating a table or tree widget involves creating items and
		setting their attributes (eg.- texts, images, etc.), after which
		the table or tree takes responsibility for displaying the items.
		This approach makes item creation straightforward and visually
		consistent. As of Eclipse 3.2, clients of Table and Tree can now
		custom draw their items, enabling a wide range of potential
		visual appearances. This article explores the custom draw
		mechanism for Table and Tree.

		<link>http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-EMF-Codegen-with-OCL/article.html</link>
		<description><![CDATA[
		This article illustrates how the EMFT OCL parser/interpreter
		technology adds to the value of EMF/JET code generation as a
		foundation for model-driven development (MDD). We will see, with
		fully functional examples, how a metamodel can be generated from
		an Ecore model without requiring any post-generation custom
		code, including complete implementations of invariant
		constraints, derived attributes and references, and operations

		<link>http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-Accessibility/index.html</link>
		<description><![CDATA[
		Accessibility for disabled users is now a priority in
		application development as advances in techniques and support
		within operating systems have now made this possible. This
		article covers the Eclipse accessibility support, general tips
		for creating accessible plug-ins, and the types of disabilities
		that the Eclipse accessibility support assists. This is all
		illustrated using an example of making a view accessible.

		<link>http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-TPTP-Profiling-Tool/tptpProfilingArticle.html</link>
		<description><![CDATA[
		This article demonstrates how to use the TPTP Profiling tool to
		profile a Java application for identifying execution related hot
		spots. It shows how to start the profiling session, use the
		various TPTP views to analyze the data, identify methods with
		high execution time then jump to the source code to fix the
		performance problem.

		<title><![CDATA[From Front End To Code - MDSD in Practice]]></title>
		<link>http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-FromFrontendToCode-MDSDInPractice/article.html</link>
		<description><![CDATA[
		Model-driven software development (MDSD) is not just about generating code. Several
		additional challenges have to be mastered. These include: how to get usable graphical and
		textual editors for your domain specific language (DSL), how to validate your models against
		your metamodels, how to define model modifications and transformations and finally, how to
		write scalable, maintainable and extensible code generators. In this article we show how to
		tackle all these challenges, based on a collection of open source tools: Eclipse, Eclipse
		Modeling Framework (EMF), Graphical Modeling Framework (GMF) as well as
		openArchitectureWare. We believe that this tool chain provides a proven and stable stack for
		making MDSD a practical reality.

		<description><![CDATA[
		The Eclipse Platform is designed for building applications,
		integrated development environments (IDEs)and arbitrary tools.
		This paper is a general technical introduction to the Eclipse
		Platform. Part I presents a technical overview of its
		architecture. Part II is a case study of how the Eclipse
		Platform was used to build a full-featured Java development
		environment.

		<description><![CDATA[
		The selection service provided by the Eclipse workbench allows
		efficient linking of different parts within the workbench
		window. Knowing and using the existing selection mechanisms
		gives your plug-ins a clean design, smoothly integrates them
		into the workbench and opens them for future extensions.

		The Language Toolkit: An API for Automated Refactorings in
		Eclipse-based IDEs
	]]></title>
		<link>http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-LTK/ltk.html</link>
		<description><![CDATA[
		Anyone who supports a programming language in an Eclipse-based
		IDE will be asked sooner or later to offer automated
		refactorings - similar to what is provided by the Java
		Development Tools (JDT). Since the release of Eclipse 3.1, at
		least part of this task--which is by no means simple--is supported
		by a language neutral API: the Language Toolkit (LTK). But how
		is this API used?

		<title><![CDATA[Rich Client Tutorial Part 2]]></title>
		<link>http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-RCP-2/tutorial2.html</link>
		<description><![CDATA[
		The Rich Client Platform (RCP) allows you to build Java
		applications that can compete with native applications on any
		platform. Part 1 of the tutorial introduced you to the platform
		and the steps used to build the smallest possible RCP program.
		In part 2 we'll look at what we did in more detail and introduce
		some of the configuration classes that let you take control of
		much of the layout and functionality of an RCP application. This
		part has been updated for Eclipse 3.1.2.

		<description><![CDATA[
		The Rich Client Platform (RCP) lets you reuse common
		functionality from the Eclipse IDE for use in your own
		applications. Parts 1 and 2 of this tutorial introduced you to
		the platform with a very simple example that did nothing but
		open a blank window. Part 3 discusses a more complicated example
		with menus, views, and other features. This part has been
		updated for Eclipse 3.1.2.
