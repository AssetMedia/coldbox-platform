				<title>Impressive ColdFusion frameworks</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/6/16/Impressive-ColdFusion-frameworks</link>
				<description>
				
				ColdFusion is a great language, and lately, with great frameworks ... &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://model-glue.com/"&gt;Model Glue: Unity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.mach-ii.info"&gt;MachII&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fusebox.org/"&gt;Fusebox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://coldspringframework.org/"&gt;ColdSpring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.doughughes.net/index.cfm?filter=category&amp;amp;categoryId=30"&gt;Reactor&lt;/a&gt;; man ... they're all are truly amazing. Anyways, let's welcome one more to this list. &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.luismajano.com/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&amp;amp;entry=DD87CC75-9A49-D4AD-012B809D61796A69"&gt;ColdBox&lt;/a&gt; was developed by a friend of mine, Luis Majano, and it's amazing. He's currently using it for Sandals Online Booking, who by the way has extremely high traffic... Luis will release this as an open source project -- thank you Luis -- so add one more framework to the list. The code and documentation will be released soon, but I've personally seen it in action and it's worth checking out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among the features you may find:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;MVC Design pattern&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;PROVEN &amp;amp; TESTED for high availabilty and mission critical applications&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Multi-Layout &amp;amp; View concept (Can be programmed at runtime if needed)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;One Centralized Variable Collection for data&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;One config.xml for implicit invocation and setup&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Event Handler CFC's&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Event Chaining&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Support for Child Applications&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Supports as many as you want child applications&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;No extra configurations, just point to the parent's system folder&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;ColdBox auto-senses if it is in a Parent or Child Application&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;ColdBox auto calculates the distance to its parent if parent code is neededBug Reports&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Event Handler Execution Profiling&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;UDF Library usage (Optional, for legacy)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Small footprint controller&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Optimized for high traffic sites&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Incorporated ColdBox Dashboard (Optional) &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Online System Update&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Online API&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Main Application Config.xml Editor&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Online Backups&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Framework extensions through Plugins&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Logger (Bug Tracking, Tracers)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Renderer (Render Logs, Views, Layouts,etc)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;FileUtilities (Java Utilities, File Utilities)Webservices (instantiation, refresh, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;ClientStorage (Permanent variable storage for clustered environment uses WDDX)Messagebox (Universal Error/Warning/Information messagebox)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Settings (ColdBox metadata and dashboard utility)Zip (A great zip utility plugin by Arthur Kordowski)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;cfcViewer (A cfc metadata retriever by Oscar Arevalo ) &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Model-Glue 2.0: Unity Public Beta 1 is Available</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/6/14/ModelGlue-20-Unity-Public-Beta-1-is-Available</link>
				<description>
				
				Joe just released Unity Beta 1 to the public; this is your chance to jump into the hottest ColdFusion technology! It is really impressive and I would definitely consider using it for my future projects. Here's an extract from &lt;a href="http://clearsoftware.net/index.cfm?mode=entry&amp;amp;entry=D5815F2A-3048-55C9-432B8F55F7D81A87" target="_blank"&gt;Joe's blog&lt;/a&gt; with what you can expect from this beta.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I'm proud to announce that I've applied the &amp;quot;Public Beta 1&amp;quot; label to revision 161 of Model-Glue:Unity. It is available for download at &lt;a href="http://www.model-glue.com/downloads.cfm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.model-glue.com/downloads.cfm&lt;/a&gt;. This version introduces automatically generated Models, codeless data access, and scaffolding. It is still very easy to learn and use.
&lt;p&gt; 		 		&lt;strong&gt;Documentation&lt;/strong&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The longest delay in releasing the framework publicly has been documentation. The XML and CFC APIs of the framework are now fully documented, the Quickstart has been rewritten, and a series of friendly &amp;quot;How-To&amp;quot; guides for common tasks are underway. The new, souped-up documentation is available at &lt;a href="http://docs.model-glue.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://docs.model-glue.com/&lt;/a&gt;.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Keeping with tradition, they still start with &amp;quot;Don't Panic!&amp;quot;  Seriously, don't.  The new stuff is super easy to learn.      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Bug Reporting&lt;/strong&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; There is now an official site at which to report framework issues.  Please report any and all problems to &lt;a href="http://trac.model-glue.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://trac.model-glue.com&lt;/a&gt; - even installation issues. If something is hard, I want to hear about it. Model-Glue is the ColdFusion framework for everyday ColdFusion programmers, and it should be easy to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Upgrading&lt;/strong&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; One goal of the beta is to insure that upgrades are seamless. You should be able to run an existing 1.x application without modification, simply by changing your Model-Glue mapping to the new version (or overwriting your old copy of Model-Glue). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; However, I'm sure something is broken, somewhere - it's just that none of the alpha testers or myself are able to find it.      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Naming&lt;/strong&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Up to this point, &amp;quot;Unity&amp;quot; has been the code name for &amp;quot;2.0,&amp;quot; but the term has stuck. The term &amp;quot;Model-Glue:Unity&amp;quot; will refer to the 2.0 core that incorporates ColdSpring and native object-relational mapping capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Reactor&lt;/strong&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; As is, Reactor is bundled with the download, and is the default Object Relational Mapping framework for Model-Glue:Unity. It is possible to support others, but would require creating a custom adapter, DataController, and scaffold .XSL files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Next Steps&lt;/strong&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In between presenting (I have seven presentations in the next two weeks, four of them on Model-Glue:Unity), I'll be working on a new Model-Glue.com, finding bugs, and fixing them as soon as they pop up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

				That's right. I've been blogging for a year now ... and it all started out as personal reminders of solutions for specific problems... I really never thought I'd be blogging this frequently and have as much traffic as I do now. Thank you all for making it interesting and challenging sometimes. I hope to create even more controversy this year to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!

				<title>Advanced (real) ColdFusion Contest Announced</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/6/11/Advanced-real-ColdFusion-Contest-Announced</link>
				<description>
				
				Ray just announced a &lt;a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/6/11/Advanced-ColdFusion-Contest-Announced" target="_blank"&gt;new Advanced ColdFusion Contest&lt;/a&gt;... he already ran one, but it involved writing Flex and most developers didn't have time to learn it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one involves a custom application to analyze code, with custom rules settings, and pluggable in the CF Admin... Sounds interesting and could involve nice RegEx's, optionally the use of CF Async Gateways? Could be nice for large amounts of data... The deadline is at the end of July, which gives you 7 weeks, or gives me 3 weeks since I won't breathe until next months anyways. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be prizes, thus far a copy of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fusion-reactor.com/"&gt;Fusion Reactor 2&lt;/a&gt;, a copy of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.interaktonline.com/"&gt;KTML&lt;/a&gt;, and more to come. I could contribute with a copy of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/"&gt;intelliJ&lt;/a&gt; if there is interest. or how about a job @ &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.ichameleongroup.com"&gt;iChameleon&lt;/a&gt;?

				<description>
				
				If you're using outlook and don't want to miss a single WorldCup game, here's an iCal file you can import with every game in US EST time. My outlook syncs to my cell and now I have the schedule everywhere I go. It's awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In your outlook, choose File Import, iCalendar.

				<title>ajaxCFC update for Model Glue and MachII</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/6/11/ajaxCFC-update-for-Model-Glue-and-MachII</link>
				<description>
				
				I previously released some examples of Ajax for &lt;a href="http://model-glue.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Model Glue&lt;/a&gt;, including port of the &lt;a href="http://robgonda.com/blog/projects/ajaxcfc/examples/modelgluesamples/contactmanager/" target="_blank"&gt;Contact Manager example&lt;/a&gt; that works with Ajax and XML Sockets. I missed to consider that most people will not be able to get the XML Socket server running, thus not being able to run this example on their servers. Added another example that uses only Ajax, without the sockets complication ... if you diff both versions, you'll find that I only changed a single line in the config file to use an ajaxLayout instead of socketLayout ... nonetheless, this should allow you to run this example out of the box ... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the moment everyone has been waiting for: &lt;a href="http://www.robgonda.com/blog/projects/ajaxcfc/examples/machiisamples/contactmanager/" target="_blank"&gt;ajaxCFC for MachII&lt;/a&gt; is out thanks to Dan Wilson! He did a great job taking the same &lt;a href="http://robgonda.com/blog/projects/ajaxcfc/examples/modelgluesamples/contactmanagerAJAX/" target="_blank"&gt;Contact Manager example&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.robgonda.com/blog/projects/ajaxcfc/examples/machiisamples/contactmanager/" target="_blank"&gt;porting it to the MachII framework&lt;/a&gt;. His implementation is really clean, using Plugins and Filters to extend the &lt;a href="http://www.mach-ii.com/" target="_blank"&gt;MachII framework&lt;/a&gt;, not to mention that the layout he built for the example is much prettier than mines :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The code is really clean and should make sense for every MachII developer. I'll try to write some documentation and instructions, but that will take some time. Sorry for delaying this post Dan, I really appreciate your contribution and so does the CF Community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy.

				<title>ajaxCFC Update: addOptions() - serializeForm()</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/6/11/ajaxCFC-Update-addOptions--serializeForm</link>
				<description>
				
				I just updated the ajaxCFC distribution files to include an update to the addOptions() utility. The &lt;a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ajaxcfc/" target="_blank"&gt;y! group&lt;/a&gt; has been talking about passing a CF Query to the addOptions() function for a few weeks and thanks to the contribution of Jeff Lester it's possible now. It behaves exactly like the addRows() function, where it takes _cell_ functions to get the value and text of the returned query. It is usually easier to learn by example, so &lt;a href="http://robgonda.com/blog/projects/ajaxcfc/examples/query/index3.cfm"&gt;check out&lt;/a&gt; how it's done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, some of you must be familiar and frustrated with the lack of ability of passing an entire form as an object; if you try, you'd get an maximum recursion error. I wrote a small function in my contact manager example that takes a form and serialize it into a JavaScript object, so I chose to include it into the DWRUtil namespace... You can now call &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;x = DWRUtil.serializeForm(document.frm)&lt;/span&gt; and pass it to your Ajax call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

				<title>JSMin for ColdFusion</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/6/11/JSMin-for-ColdFusion</link>
				<description>
				
				&lt;a href="http://javascript.crockford.com/jsmin.html" target="_blank"&gt;JSMin&lt;/a&gt; is a utility to compress JavaScript by removing unnecessary whitespace and comments. Unlike &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscated_code" target="_blank"&gt;obfuscation&lt;/a&gt;, it doesn't rename any of your variables or functions, leaving the core functionality intact. Depending on amount of comments, this utility may save from 50-80% on file size. Here's a good &lt;a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2006/03/06/minification-v-obfuscation/" target="_blank"&gt;Minification Vs. Obfuscation article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darryl Lyons released &lt;a href="http://www.acheron.org/darryl/cfjsmin/" target="_blank"&gt;CFJSMin&lt;/a&gt;, a ColdFusion utility to compress JavaScripts. I'm not sure why would you want to compress your scripts from a server side scripting language instead of running a binary executable... I guess that if you have a source folder and production folder you could automate changes... CFJSMin also has the ability of taking several input files and save them all in a single compressed file. This is good for caching. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darryl, if you're reading this, here's a request: I'd like the tool to read several JS files as input, but instead of writing a target file, I'd like the output in a variable. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition of compressing your files, take a look at &lt;a href="http://www.gzip.org/" target="_blank"&gt;gzip&lt;/a&gt; and real time data compression. Here's a &lt;a href="http://www.wwwcoder.com/main/parentid/170/site/3669/68/default.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;good article&lt;/a&gt; on how to set your IIS to compression. For those who run apache, I know it's really easy, but I don't have the information handy.

				<title>Model Glue 2.0 a.k.a Unity Video</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/6/10/Model-Glue-20-aka-Unity-Video</link>
				<description>
				
				Joe &lt;a href="http://clearsoftware.net/index.cfm?mode=entry&amp;amp;entry=BA6B158E-3048-55C9-437C2E41D40C095F" target="_blank"&gt;released a must see video&lt;/a&gt; where he uses &lt;a href="http://model-glue.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Model Glue&lt;/a&gt; 2.0 to quickly build a blog -- under 9 minutes. MG2.0 makes use of &lt;a href="http://www.coldspringframework.org/" target="_blank"&gt;ColdSpring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.doughughes.net/index.cfm?filter=category&amp;amp;categoryId=30" target="_blank"&gt;Reactor&lt;/a&gt; to generate components, define relationships, and wire them together... Joe didn't write a single sql statement, it was all purely based on defining events and configuring some xml files. Very impressive I must say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Model Glue 2.0 will go public beta probably this week and final release @ &lt;a href="http://cfunited.com/" target="_blank"&gt;CFUnited&lt;/a&gt;.

				<title>CFLive! AJAX for ColdFusion Recording</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/6/8/CFLive-AJAX-for-ColdFusion-Recording</link>
				<description>
				
				I did my CFLive presentation today ... let's clarify --again-- that it was only a sneak preview of CFUnited, not a class, demo, or tutorial... I didn't talk about ajaxCFC or any particular implementation. I listed all the topics I'm planning to cover at CFUnited, did a quick Ajax overview, and showed a few examples... &lt;a href="http://stevenerat.breezecentral.com/p57434819/ " target="_blank"&gt;The Breeze presentation was recorded and it is available for everyone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may also &lt;a href="/blog/files/robGonda/UserFiles/File/CFLive-_CFUnited_sneak_peek_-_June_08_2006.pdf"&gt;download&lt;/a&gt; the slides if wish.

				<title>Why Spry: Kevin Lynch answered me</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/6/5/Why-Spry-Kevin-Lynch-answered-me</link>
				<description>
				
				A few days ago, &lt;a href="http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/6/3/Difference-of-Ajax-Libraries--Frameworks--Toolkits"&gt;I posted an entry&lt;/a&gt; asking why is Adobe entering the Ajax world? I just found this entry where &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://searchwebservices.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid26_gci1191914,00.html"&gt;Kevin explains&lt;/a&gt; the main idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to be pretty good at knowing code to use the frameworks. So what we worked on here [in &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/spry/"&gt;Spry&lt;/a&gt;] is how can we get designers more involved in Ajax?&lt;br /&gt;Kevin Lynch&lt;br /&gt;Chief Software Architect, Adobe Systems Inc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea seems to be that Adobe wants to reach designers, not developers. Kevin claims that a designer can use this framework and implement Ajax sites / widgets, thus enhancing the user experience without coding. The Spry framework allows you to retrieve remote dynamic data by using a data binding mechanism, to which some Flash developers are familiar. This approach doesn't fully exploit the advantages of Ajax, and I'm not sure if it even provides any. Can someone think of how a designer could use this framework and why should he even care? I'm not trying to discourage Adobe, this _may_ be a great idea, but I'm blind. I guess I'll have to wait and see how a designer takes advantage of it and show me how Ajax makes him stand above the competition ... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone have a different point of view?

				&lt;a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Ray&lt;/a&gt; released &lt;a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/blogcfc" target="_blank"&gt;blogCFC 5&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks ago but I was hesitant to migrate because of all the custom modifications I've done ... I decided to switch today and overall it wasn't that bad ... my CFC's (xml rpcs, fckeditor, ...) worked without any problem at the first trial, thus the only tedious job was to switch my l&amp;amp;f, adwords, and tracking to the new div/css based layout ... I'm sure I will find something I missed, but I'm really happy with the fact it only took me an hours to migrate. Thanks again Ray!

				<title>Dojo 0.3.0 Now Available</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/6/3/Dojo-030-Now-Available</link>
				<description>
				
				&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://dojotoolkit.org/"&gt;Dojo 0.3.0&lt;/a&gt; was released with many new features. Dojo must be the best JavaScript library, it really makes me think if I should rewrite some ColdFusion components to generate Dojo widgets and Ajax binding ... sounds like a great project too me, if you're interested drop me an email.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the Ajax Experience, Alex demonstrated a new use of the Flash Platform with Ajax: storage! Flash has be ability of storing large amount of data local objects, which is something like a Flash Cookie. By default you can store 300k of persistent data, up to 500k. Dojo makes use of this storage transparently by using a 1px flash component ... really neat. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 		The &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://download.dojotoolkit.org/release-0.3.0/dojo-0.3.0-ajax.zip"&gt;latest 		release of Dojo&lt;/a&gt; has a slew of new features, including: 	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Less boilerplate when writing widgets&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A new lightweight animation system that makes using and building animations dead simple&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Tested, high-performance local storage engine&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Cross-domain Ajax support and cross-domain package loading&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The ability to bundle CSS as well as HTML in profile builds&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Better performance&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; 			New widgets:
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;SortableTable&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;TitlePane&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Form validation&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Menus and menu bars&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Google and Yahoo maps&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; 			And more than a hundred other &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://trac.dojotoolkit.org/query?status=closed&amp;amp;milestone=0.3release"&gt;bug 			fixes and improvements&lt;/a&gt;. 		&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Difference of Ajax Libraries / Frameworks / Toolkits</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/6/3/Difference-of-Ajax-Libraries--Frameworks--Toolkits</link>
				<description>
				
				I just &lt;a href="http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/6/3/More-than-seven-Ajax-products-to-watch-out-for"&gt;listed&lt;/a&gt; a bunch of Ajax frameworks, libraries, and toolkits ... I just realized I need to go back a step... what is the difference among them? These are the differences how I see them; it's not an official definition, but just explaining the differences in simple words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Library: consists only of a series of functions.&lt;br /&gt;example: Dojo, prototype, script.aculo.us&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Framework: library plus methodology, event or process management, and other utilities that facilitates writing a program.&lt;br /&gt;example: Fusebox, Model Glue, Mach II&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toolkit: framework plus an IDE. It's a complete solution for your needs.&lt;br /&gt;example: Microsoft Atlas, Ticbo GI, Zimbra AT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyways, Adobe is developing their version of an Ajax Library called &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/spry/"&gt;Spry&lt;/a&gt;. Ray Camden &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/6/2/I-heart-Spry"&gt;seems to like it&lt;/a&gt;. I haven't tried it yet, but I will sometime this upcoming week. Not sure why Adobe is even interested in getting in this game, unless they have some big plans of taking this library and allowing for creating Ajax pages with server side calls through ColdFusion ... I'll post more on this soon.

				<title>More than seven Ajax products to watch out for</title>

				Harshad Harshad Oak posted &lt;a href="http://www.indicthreads.com/articles/447/seven_ajax_frameworks_toolkits.html" target="_blank"&gt;an entry&lt;/a&gt; with seven Ajax toolkits / frameworks to watch out for ... &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/"&gt;Google Web Toolkit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://dojotoolkit.org/"&gt;Dojo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/"&gt;Yahoo! User Interface Library&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://getahead.ltd.uk/dwr/"&gt;Direct Web Remoting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/spry/"&gt;Spry framework for Ajax&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://mochikit.com/"&gt;Mochikit&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://script.aculo.us/"&gt;Script.aculo.us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of them I agree, some not ... and it's missing a few too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GWT may succeed just because it's Google; it's nice and intuitive for Java Developers, but somewhat limited. We should expect major improvements in this framework over the next few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dojo is the best JavaScript library out there... really nicely thought, OOP, with many Widgets and Ajax support. It is also being used by the Open Ajax Effort, which is developing an IDE built over Eclipse... &lt;br /&gt;The Y! UIL has great patterns and their userbase is growing. I haven't followed it closely, but I wouldn't bet money on this one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DRW is being developed by Joe Walker. He's a very bright guy, but being alone in this game doesn't help... DRW 2.0 is coming soon and has built in capabilities for reverse Ajax / comet and JSF interfaces... Up till now DWR was the most widely used library in the Java world, but GWT has a greater chance to succeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spry is an attempt from Adobe to get in the game. IMO, unless Adobe builds this in ColdFusion somehow, they have no business here. It's a nice framework, somewhat limited at the moment, not advertised, but no where nearly as mature as many other frameworks...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mochikit is too small ... it&amp;nbsp; will not grow as fast as needed and disappear over time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Script.aculo.us is a nice low level animation library. It doesn't do Ajax and shouldnt be on this list. While it's a great library, used by RoR and will be around forever, it doesn't belong in this list. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to all these products, we're missing some big players! Microsoft for instance. &lt;a href="http://atlas.asp.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Atlas&lt;/a&gt; will be by far the most widely used Ajax framework ... I am not a Microsoft fan myself, but Altas was very well thought and it's a great product. Also, &lt;a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Laszlo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.tibco.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Tibco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.zimbra.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Zimbra AT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.backbase.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Backbase&lt;/a&gt;, are larger than many libraries mentioned in this list... All of them are mature products, some are commercial, but you deserve to be on this list. &lt;br /&gt;
