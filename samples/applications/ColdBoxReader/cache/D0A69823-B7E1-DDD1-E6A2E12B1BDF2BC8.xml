				<title>ajaxCFC utils update</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/9/10/ajaxCFC-utils-update</link>
				<description>
				
				I just updated ajaxCFC with a massively refactored utils class, including highlight handler, improved form serialization, debugging, and the ability to use image loading indicators (brought to you by &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.reybango.com/index.cfm/2006/8/16/Adding-an-Ajax-Indicator-Image-in-AjaxCFC"&gt;Rey Bango&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to use the image loading indicator use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;DWRUtil.useLoadingImage(&amp;quot;/images/ajax-loader.gif&amp;quot;); &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;You may find a bunch of indicators at &lt;a href="http://www.ajaxload.info/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ajaxload.info/&lt;/a&gt;

				<title>ColdFusion and Flex: Do you need Flex Data Services?</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/9/9/ColdFusion-and-Flex-Do-you-need-Flex-Data-Services</link>
				<description>
				
				Adobe Flex 2 has been out for a couple of months now, and lots of ColdFusion customers are discovering that the combination of ColdFusion and Flex allows them to deliver powerful and engaging applications easier than ever before.
&lt;p&gt; One area of confusion appears to be the Adobe Flex server: Adobe Flex Data Services. What is Adobe Flex Data Services? What exactly does Flex Data Services allow you to do that you wouldn't be able to do without it? What does this mean specifically to us ColdFusion developers? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Ben Forta's new article Adobe Developer Center article entitled &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/coldfusion/articles/fr_fds.html"&gt;ColdFusion and Flex: Do you need Flex Data Services?&lt;/a&gt; explains. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Ajax for ColdFusion Developers Breeze Presso next week</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/9/6/Ajax-for-ColdFusion-Developers-Breeze-Presso-next-week</link>
				<description>
				
				I'll be presenting Ajax for ColdFusion Developers to both the &lt;a href="http://www.bostoncfug.org/" target="_blank"&gt;local Boston CFUG&lt;/a&gt; and also the &lt;a href="http://coldfusion.meetup.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Online ColdFusion Meetup Group&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The event detail for the OCFMG is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://coldfusion.meetup.com/17/events/5113555/" target="_blank"&gt;http://coldfusion.meetup.com/17/events/5113555/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was tempted to use the same pressos I have at the Ajax World Conference, but I think I may change it up a bit and add some opinions about Spry, Ajax Vs. Flex, ColdFusion Frameworks, and then some... I want this not to be another Ajax presentation, but something that clears up doubts in the community ... if you have any specific topics you want me to cover, there is still time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you all there.

				<title>ajaxCFC: more small fixes</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/9/6/ajaxCFC-more-small-fixes</link>
				<description>
				
				just uploaded a new release of AjaxCFC with a couple of fixes:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;backwards compatibility for single arguments with an object, provided by nathanael waite. You may add the setComplexInputStruct(boolean) to the top of your function to enable or disable allowing argumentCollections to be passed to ajaxCFC. If enabled and a single object is passed as an arguments, it will be threaded as a collection. This is enabled by default.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;fix in the argumentCollection option mentioned above to allow passing a single array argument. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
More to come soon.

				<title>ajaxCFC quick patch</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/8/30/ajaxCFC-quick-patch</link>
				<description>
				
				I just uploaded a small patch into &lt;a href="http://www.robgonda.com/blog/projects/ajaxcfc" target="_blank"&gt;ajaxCFC&lt;/a&gt; for the Model-Glue examples to work on the CFMX DevNet Edition. I had the core examples already patched, but I found that the MG were not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will release a major engine update within the next few days.

				<title>South Florida CFUG Reminder</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/8/30/South-Florida-CFUG-Reminder</link>
				<description>
				
				Quick reminder: I'll be speaking tomorrow at the &lt;a href="http://www.cfug-sfl.org/" target="_blank"&gt;South Florida CFUG&lt;/a&gt;. The session is on &lt;a href="http://www.model-glue.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Model-Glue&lt;/a&gt; and Unity. I will start with defining design patterns, implicit invocation, MVC, and then go into detail about the MG implementation: data flow, event handlers, listeners, models, views, ... To cover Unity I would probably need several hours, so I don't think I will get into scaffolding, and ColdSpring in details (autowiring, proxies, aop) ... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll post my slides tomorrow.

				<title>weird pages linking back</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/8/25/weird-pages-linking-back</link>
				<description>
				
				Has anyone seen this type of crap before? Every single day I find new sites with dummy content mentioning my name/blog linking back ... What could be the reason for this? Traffic, clickthroughs, ad-sense? Does anyone else have this problem?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;e.g. these just came up last night&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://rajax.rafflesiapages.com/?p=36&lt;br /&gt;http://encleangreaseoffpansthe.blogspot.com/2006/08/clean-grease-off-pans_17.html&lt;br /&gt;http://howcleangreaseoffpanswith.blogspot.com/2006/08/clean-grease-off-pans_24.html&lt;br /&gt;http://whenasseenontvdoggierampto.blogspot.com/2006/08/as-seen-on-tv-doggie-ramp_24.html&lt;br /&gt;http://thecleangreaseor.blogspot.com/2006/08/clean-grease_25.html&lt;br /&gt;http://thisasseenontvdoggierampwhat.blogspot.com/2006/08/as-seen-on-tv-doggie-ramp_25.html

				<title>Ajax Debugging Tip</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/8/24/Ajax-Debugging-Tip</link>
				<description>
				
				Rey Bango posted a &lt;a href="http://www.reybango.com/index.cfm/2006/8/24/AjaxCFC-Debugging-Tip" target="_blank"&gt;nice entry&lt;/a&gt; to help debug Ajax calls. The problem people usually run into is that Ajax triggers a remote call in the background and they have no idea to see why it failed. ajaxCFC will show you the ColdFusion error, if any, but if the problem breaks to communication for some reason it will just say invalid reply from the server... but why?! I always tell people to install a nice http sniffer, and Rey confirms it.&lt;br /&gt;The moral of the story is: use &lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.com" target="_blank"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;, use &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1843/" target="_blank"&gt;FireBug&lt;/a&gt;.

				<title>little tip for model-glue: unity</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/8/23/little-tip-for-modelglue-unity</link>
				<description>
				
				If you're developing in Model-Glue:Unity, you may already know that you are working with ColdSpring and Reactor. ColdSpring may seem obvious because you set up all Model-Glue's properties with ColdSpring; as the matter of fact, Model-Glue is a ColdSpring application. &lt;br /&gt;However, Model-Glue also ties to Reactor, which you may decide to use or not. A little performance tip is to set Reactor to production mode if you're not using it, because whether you use it or not, it will take up resources. &lt;br /&gt;To chance it to production mode open ColdSpring.xml, find the reactorConfiguration bean, and modify the mode to &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&amp;lt;property name=&amp;quot;mode&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;value&amp;gt;production&amp;lt;/value&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/property&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still not sure exactly why it would make such a difference, but in the project I'm currently working, which does not use Reactor at all, it improved the load time from 700ms to 100ms, having Model-Glue set to always reload.

				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/8/17/Google-Analytics-Open-to-Everyone</link>
				<description>
				
				Google just removed the wait to receive a Google Analytics account. Now anyone with a website can instantly create one for free by simply by visiting &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/analytics" target="_blank"&gt;google.com/analytics&lt;/a&gt; or by clicking on the &amp;quot;Analytics&amp;quot; tab within AdWords.  After you create an account, they suggest reading the &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/support/analytics/bin/answer.py?answer=40932" target="_blank"&gt;Installation Guide&lt;/a&gt; to get it set up quickly and correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been using Google Analytics for a while and I like it a lot; the best part: it's free!

				<title>JavaScript Model-View-Controller with Dojo toolkit</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/8/8/JavaScript-ModelViewController-with-Dojo-toolkit</link>
				<description>
				
				You probably know how I love design patterns and apply them all over CF ... You also know I love Dojo :) ... I just found &lt;a href="http://www.alexatnet.com/Blog/Index/2006-08-04/javascript-model-view-controller-with-dojo-toolkit" target="_blank"&gt;this nice article&lt;/a&gt; showing how to apply MVC in JavaScript with Dojo. I don't extensively use JavaScript, but it's a nice implementation.

				<title>updated to blogcfc 5.1.004</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/8/8/updated-to-blogcfc-51004</link>
				<description>
				
				I just updated my blog from v5.004 to 5.1.004. I was reading in the blogsphere that this update was a bit of a hassle, or did not go smoothly for some people. In my case, so far so good (knock on wood). I just upgraded 5 mins ago and thus far nothing's broken. I backed up my entire 5.004 folder and overwrote everything with the new version; then I modified some custom files I have, such as application, layout, admin entry pages (fckeditor), ping rpc .. that's it ... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If someone notice something broken please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again Ray, you rock!&lt;br /&gt;

				<title>CFMX7 + W2k3sp1 = Access is denied</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/8/7/CFMX7--W2k3sp1--Access-is-denied</link>
				<description>
				
				I just can't believe there is no official documentation on this issue. If you ever tried to install ColdFusion MX7 on a Windows 2003 Server with sp1 pre installed, your ColdFusion will not install properly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just tried to install it over 20-30 times, changing settings, nt security, firewall, web server, jrun, man .. everything! I tried to install it on an AMD 64 bit CPU running Windows 2003 Server. The 64 bit threw me off, and I almost returned it and ordered a new system... the strange fact is that I have other AMD 64bits running ... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of the installation type, standalone, multiserver, using the built-in web server, iis, or apache, it will always finish the install with errors. If you look at the logs you will see 2 or 3 non-fatal errors:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ERROR - jrun.xmljava.io.FileNotFoundException: C:\JRun4\tmpmove.bat (Access is denied)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;or&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ERROR - jrun.xmljava.io.FileNotFoundException: C:\CFusionMX7\tmpmove.bat (Access is denied)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Web Server Connector Configuration Error&lt;br /&gt;Status: ERROR&lt;br /&gt;Additional Notes: ERROR - JNDI port 2902 for server cfusion is not active&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last one I don't have the exact error, but it was something along the line of cannot find C:\CFUsionMX7\lib&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Missing the entire /lib folder does not look so 'non-fatal' to me. Anyways, ColdFusion would not start. After trying everything known to man, I even tried to copy the /lib folder from another server.... nada, nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found two solutions to this problem:&lt;br /&gt;1) Reinstall sp1 on top of the pre-installed sp1.&lt;br /&gt;2) A little easier, and I still don't know why this works, install CF with the silent mode. Run the CF install file from a command line (DOS box) with &amp;quot;-f silent.properties&amp;quot; and it will take 2 mins to install. Silent.properties is a file that you must create using a text editor. See &lt;a href="http://www.macromedia.com/go/87bd20f4" target="_blank"&gt;this technote&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I installed it silently with the built-in server, and then manually attached the IIS connectors. It also installed the Report Builder, I guess it's part of the silent install... so I removed it after it was done. I kept a copy of the silent.properties if anyone needs it, but it's close to the template provided in the technote.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adobe should document this issue! Next time you're installing CFMX7 on a W2k3 box, remember this post, it may save you days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
