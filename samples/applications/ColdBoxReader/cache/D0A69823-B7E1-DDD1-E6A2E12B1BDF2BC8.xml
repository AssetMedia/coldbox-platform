				<title>IMified powered by ColdFusion and AjaxCFC</title>

				<description>
				
				&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.imified.com/"&gt;Imified&lt;/a&gt; is an instant messenger buddy that offers access to productivity tools like notes, reminders, and todo's. The site is powered by ColdFusion and their IM bot is done through CFMX7 Event Gateways. However, the most important business aspect is that their back-end / account management is all AjaxCFC! :-&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concept is great because it's simple, yet very handy... I wish them luck and hope they add many more features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wrote a few bots before, but quickly ran into licensing issues with the networks. All networks restrict the amount of messages a single user can send/receive per day, and some networks charge up to $50,000 simply to allow your bot to live.

				<title>Speaking at CFUnited Express - Atlanta</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/2/15/Speaking-at-CFUnited-Express--Atlanta</link>
				<description>
				
				&lt;a href="http://cfunitedexpress.com/go/atlanta/2007/" target="_blank"&gt;CFUnited express&lt;/a&gt; invited me to speak next month in Atlanta, next to Charlie Arehart, Ben Forta, Hal Helms, and Andrew Powell. It will be a one-day event that you can attend risk free if you're planning to attend the main CFUnited event, since the entire cover price will count towards your CFUnited ticket. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be speaking again on Ajax, Charlie on caching and performance, Ben on Apollo, and Hal on large-scale applications. I'm really exited about speaking and attending the other sessions. Hope to see a few familiar faces there.

				<title>Microsoft SQL Server Database Publishing Wizard</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/2/12/Microsoft-SQL-Server-Database-Publishing-Wizard</link>
				<description>
				
				The &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=29b4ffd8-ac3a-4481-b352-9b185619a901&amp;amp;DisplayLang=en" target="_blank"&gt;SQL Server Database Publishing Wizard&lt;/a&gt; enables the deployment of SQL Server databases into a hosted environment on either a SQL Server 2000 or 2005 server. It generates a single SQL script file which can be used to recreate a database (both schema and data) in a shared hosting environment where the only connectivity to a server is through a web-based control panel with a script execution window. If supported by the hosting service provider, the Database Publishing Wizard can also directly upload databases to servers located at the shared hosting provider.

				<title>AjaxCFC for jQuery Alpha3 Release</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/2/11/AjaxCFC-for-jQuery-Alpha3-Release</link>
				<description>
				
				I just updated the SVN with the 3rd alpha release of AjaxCFC for jQuery. For those of you not familiarized with source control repositories, I included the code into the main AjaxCFC download (thank Rey Bango for reminding me four times a day), available at &lt;a href="http://ajaxcfc.riaforge.org/" target="_blank"&gt;RIAForge&lt;/a&gt; and my blog. You can also just click &lt;a href="http://www.robgonda.com/blog/projects/ajaxcfc/download.cfm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This release includes several small fixes in the JavaScript and upgrade to the latest CFJSON. Thanks to Larry Reinhard for pointing it out.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The code seems to be really stable; I haven't got many bug reports, au contraire, Jacob Munson, from &lt;a href="http://www.cfquickdocs.com/" target="_blank"&gt;CFQuickDocs&lt;/a&gt;, said he dropped it into his code w/o any complications, maintaining all existing functionality.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I shall wrap up some documentation and officially release it for production.

				<title>SEO Advice needed</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/2/9/SEO-Advice-needed</link>
				<description>
				
				A couple of days ago I thought Google loved me. Immediately after I posted an entry, all the keywords for this entry showed up in the very first place in Google; but my happiness did not last. My blog get aggregated by a few large itechnology portals and after a few days, Google spidered their copy of my entry. Immediately after this event, they took my place in Google and took me completely out of it. It seems like their post has more authority than mine, the content is the same (its aggregated), therefore, theirs stay, and mine goes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is there anything I can do about this? I'd like to keep the aggregators, but somehow claim ownership of the article. Is that mutually exclusive? Is that what micro-ids are all about? Any help would be appreciated.

				<title>Leverage SQL Session at the South Florida CFUG</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/2/7/Leverage-SQL-Session-at-the-South-Florida-CFUG</link>
				<description>
				
				I will be speaking this coming February 22nd at the &lt;a href="http://www.cfug-sfl.org/" target="_blank"&gt;South Florida CFUG&lt;/a&gt;. For this month I chose a topic that will benefit you regardless of your programming language of preference, and should hopefully allow to you take back something that you can apply immediately. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Topic:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Leverage the power of SQL&lt;br /&gt;Description: &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Many developers don't realize the power of SQL to perform data related tasks and computations. Learn how to utilize triggers, stored procedures, constraints, and user-defined-functions to their full potential, and see the huge impact this could have in your organization or day-to-day coding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tell your friends.

				<title>ColdFusion Vs. SQL UUID</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/2/4/ColdFusion-Vs-SQL-UUID</link>
				<description>
				
				A few days ago I &lt;a href="/blog/index.cfm/2007/1/27/Database-Data-Integrity-The-Basics"&gt;blogged&lt;/a&gt; about database level data integrity and promised a follow up concentrating in uuids. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A UUID stands for Universally Unique Identifier. The intent of UUIDs is to enable distributed systems to uniquely identify information without significant central coordination. Thus, anyone can create a UUID and use it to identify something with reasonable confidence that the identifier will never be unintentionally used by anyone for anything else. Information labelled with UUIDs can therefore be later combined into a single database without needing to resolve name conflicts. The most widespread use of this standard is in Microsoft's Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs) which implement this standard (source: wikipedia).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A UUID is essentially a 16-byte (128-bit) number. In its canonical form a UUID may look like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx (8-4-4-4-12)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, for some reason ColdFusion's UUID looks like&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx (8-4-4-16) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Microsoft SQL has a native datatype called uniqueidentifier, which represents the 36-characters GUID. Many ColdFusion developers choose not to use the GUID because it cannot be implicitly validated by ColdFusion and it cannot be seamlessly moved to a different database like mysql, postgre, oracle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most widely adopted solution is to use a 35-character primary key and insert a ColdFusion UUID, nonetheless, how do you validate a proper uuid at the database level? What if you want the database to generate the primary key? If the key gets altered, it will fail ColdFusions implicit UUID datatype validation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solution is to add some constraints in the database level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it really simple to generate a UUID, since all it takes it just to remove the 4th hyphen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;CREATE FUNCTION dbo.newUUID(@GUID varchar(36))&lt;br /&gt;RETURNS varchar(35)&lt;br /&gt;AS&lt;br /&gt;BEGIN&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;RETURN left(@GUID, 23) + right(@GUID,12)&lt;br /&gt;END&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that due to limitations and not being able to invoke a newID() function inside a user defined function, we need to pass the GUID. Now, that said, we can add a default value to our primary keys and let SQL Server generate them for us:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;Default Value: dbo.newUUID(newid())&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; To validate a proper UUID is a little more complicated, since SQL has no native isUUID or isGUID function. I chose to use a regular expression, but guess what? SQL Server 2000 has no regular expression capabilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So step one is to create a regular expression evaluator function&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;CREATE FUNCTION dbo.find_regular_expression&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; @source varchar(5000),&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; @regexp varchar(1000),&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; @ignorecase bit = 0&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; )&lt;br /&gt;RETURNS bit&lt;br /&gt;AS&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; BEGIN&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; DECLARE @hr integer&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; DECLARE @objRegExp integer&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; DECLARE @objMatches integer&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; DECLARE @objMatch integer&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; DECLARE @count integer&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; DECLARE @results bit&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; EXEC @hr = sp_OACreate 'VBScript.RegExp', @objRegExp OUTPUT&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; IF @hr &amp;lt;&amp;gt; 0 BEGIN&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; SET @results = 0&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; RETURN @results&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; END&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; EXEC @hr = sp_OASetProperty @objRegExp, 'Pattern', @regexp&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; IF @hr &amp;lt;&amp;gt; 0 BEGIN&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; SET @results = 0&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; RETURN @results&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; END&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; EXEC @hr = sp_OASetProperty @objRegExp, 'Global', false&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; IF @hr &amp;lt;&amp;gt; 0 BEGIN&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; SET @results = 0&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; RETURN @results&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; END&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; EXEC @hr = sp_OASetProperty @objRegExp, 'IgnoreCase', @ignorecase&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; IF @hr &amp;lt;&amp;gt; 0 BEGIN&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; SET @results = 0&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; RETURN @results&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; END&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; EXEC @hr = sp_OAMethod @objRegExp, 'Test', @results OUTPUT, @source&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; IF @hr &amp;lt;&amp;gt; 0 BEGIN&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; SET @results = 0&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; RETURN @results&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; END&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; EXEC @hr = sp_OADestroy @objRegExp&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; IF @hr &amp;lt;&amp;gt; 0 BEGIN&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; SET @results = 0&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; RETURN @results&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; END&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; RETURN @results&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; END&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that we have this, all we need is the UUID regEx pattern and call this function. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;CREATE FUNCTION dbo.isUUID (@uuid varchar(35))&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;RETURNS bit AS&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;BEGIN &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DECLARE @uuidRegex varchar(50)&lt;br /&gt;SET @uuidRegex = '^[0-9A-F]{8}-[0-9A-F]{4}-[0-9A-F]{4}-[0-9A-F]{16}$'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RETURN dbo.find_regular_expression(@uuid,@uuidRegex ,0)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;END&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alright! now we have a isUUID function, which you can easily invoke from everywhere... open a sql script and execute &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;SELECT [dbo].[isUUID]('D929E4FB-537C-495F-BB3F31B8E42C0FBB') &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that we tested it and know how it works, all we need is to add a constraint to your primary key:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Open your table in design mode, click constraints, new, and add this line:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;([dbo].[isUUID]([ID]) = 1)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;where ID is the name of the primary key.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you learned how to generate a UUID, default your primary key to use one, validate a UUID regEx, and add a constraint to enforce db data integrity.

				<description>
				
				The &lt;a href="http://www.cfobjective.com/conference/index.cfm?event=page.speakers" target="_blank"&gt;speakers list is now up at the cf.Objective() site&lt;/a&gt;. I couldn't assist last year, but I heard nothing but great stories, so I'm really happy to make it this year. Sessions and topics will be posted shortly, but registration is already open. Trust me, no matter what are the final topics, just look at the speakers, you know it will be good. Hope to see you all there.

				<title>Framework Conference highlights</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/2/3/Framework-Conference-highlights</link>
				<description>
				
				The &lt;a href="http://www.frameworksconference.com/" target="_blank"&gt;frameworks conference&lt;/a&gt; was great... big applause to Liz and the Teratech team for putting it together. Like in most conferences, I only made it to a selected number of sessions, however, I learned a lot from the speakers at the bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two sessions I enjoyed the most were Hal Helm's Interface Driven Architecture, and Chris Scott's Intro to Aspect Oriented Programming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The food was great; we had food available from 8am till 6pm ... We had a foosball tournament and the prize was two Flex 2.0 licenses... too bad the tables were even worse than the beat-up one at my office :) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.frameworksconference.com/pages/topics.cfm#topic-956" target="_blank"&gt;My session&lt;/a&gt; was on object factories, providing some history and evolution in CF programming, and examples taking apart Ray Camden's Galleon forums and showing alternative ways to wire dependencies together. Ray assisted my presso and it seems like &lt;a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2007/2/2/Frameworks-Conference-Intro-to-Object-Factories--Rob-Gonda" target="_blank"&gt;I could have made a difference&lt;/a&gt;; that's great!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll post my slides and code shortly, plus a bonus video or two, showing what speakers really do at these conferences.

				<title>cfcUnit 1.2 beta 1 now with Ant</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/2/3/cfcUnit-12-beta-1-now-with-Ant</link>

				After a long wait, Paul &lt;a href="http://www.pjk.us/pjk/blog/index.cfm?event=showEntryForID&amp;amp;entry=8197668F-3048-28E9-DAE74E51B32F41AE" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the beta release of cfcUnit 1.2, which now finally includes Ant support. cfcUnit allows you to perform tests on very specific functionality of your components (units), and now they can be funny automated with your builds by being invoked by Ant right from within Eclipse. I know Paul has been working on this for a long time under Sean's pressure, so you know this code must be good. You can get the latest release at &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=100854&amp;amp;package_id=126568&amp;amp;release_id=483297" target="_blank"&gt;sourceforge&lt;/a&gt;.

				<title>Database Data Integrity: The Basics</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/1/27/Database-Data-Integrity-The-Basics</link>
				<description>
				
				Applications have usually multiple tiers, such as user interface, business model, and data. It is not an uncommon practice to rely on the application level for data validation, since in most cases, it is a single application that interacts with one particular database. However, what would happen if one field got 'corrupt', because of a bug in the application? What would happen if multiple applications accessed the same data, and but one was missing a particular validation rule? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The data is held in a database, and it should be the database that maintained and verified integrity. You must be thinks, of course, you define datatypes and&amp;nbsp; table relations, but that's not enough. How many times have you -- or your dba -- defined a gender field as a char(1), or a uuid primary key as a char(35)? What makes you think that somehow, let's call it glitch, the gender field couldn't end up with a 'x' value, when you're only accepting 'm' or 'f'? or the id key could end up with '400', when taking only uuids. Chances are in fact, that your application in fact may be validating a uuid datatype, since it's native to ColdFusion, and anything other than a uuid key will break your application. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, and without pointing at anyone, I've downloaded and played with dozens of open-source applications that use a uuid as a primary key, providing a sql schema script that does not validate that a proper uuid is being placed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is the solution? Constraints; and they should always be used. A constraint is nothing but a rule that all data have to comply, enforced at the database level. The most common constraints is the foreign key, where the database automatically enforce one column value (fk) to match any column value of a different table (pk), which are automatically created when you declare foreign keys&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, you can also create your own constraints, for example, gender have to be 'm', or 'f'; a credit card expiration have to be between 2005 and 2020, number of children have to be between 0 and 20, and so on. Your datatype can only restrict so much, but you can add additional validation to ensure that if falls into your business logic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can add constrains using sql scripts, or using sql GUI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following examples are for Microsoft SQL, but should be able to adapt them to any database that supports constraints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To add a constraint to a gender field with datatype char(1), simple open the table in design mode, click the constraint icon (top toolbar, right icon, shape of a grid) and click the new button. The constraint expression must return a boolean; type ([gender] = 'f' or [gender] = 'm'). Following, you may assign any name to this constraint, commonly prefixed by CK_ for check. (&lt;a href="/blog/files/robGonda/UserFiles/Image/mssql constraints1.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;see screen shot&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To add the same constraints by scripting, you may open a script window or the query analyzer and type the following&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;ALTER TABLE [dbo].[users] ADD &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; CONSTRAINT [CK_users_gender] CHECK ([gender] = 'f' or [gender] = 'm')&lt;br /&gt;GO&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After this is in place, anytime you try to insert or alter the gender field with any character other than 'f' or 'm', the database will throw an error, which you can catch with the constraint name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow I will post how to validate regular expressions, including UUID datatypes.

				<description>
				
				Good news: &lt;a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org/" target="_blank"&gt;CFEclipse 1.3&lt;/a&gt; is out; thanks Mark! It is one of the many Eclipse plugins I use daily, and by far the best tool to write ColdFusion code.&amp;nbsp;

				<title>jQuery 1.1.1 update</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/1/25/jQuery-111-update</link>
				<description>
				
				If you're using &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://jquery.com/"&gt;jQuery&lt;/a&gt; 1.1, download immediately the 1.1.1 update. There are a few minor bugs that were fixed, but one was major for me. (see the full list &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://jquery.com/blog/2007/01/22/jquery-111/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;The first item: Setting the numerical value of a css property failed, for example: .css(&amp;rdquo;opacity&amp;rdquo;,0.5) (also occurred with zIndex, fontWeight), which by the way only affected IE, was causing my &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://interface.eyecon.ro"&gt;interface&lt;/a&gt; drag and drop not to work. For those of you not familiar with interface, it's a collection of components made in form of plugins that facilitate the development of Rich User Interfaces.&lt;br /&gt;The particular problem I ran into was defining draggables. The code looks as follows: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;$('#drag2').Draggable(&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; zIndex: &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 1000,&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ghosting:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; true,&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; opacity: &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 0.7&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }&lt;br /&gt;);&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Behind the scenes, this invokes the $().css('zIndex', 1000) function, which for some bizarre reason was translated into setting zIndex to 1000px; go figure. What amazes me with that Firefox, the all standard based web browser, actually ran this code, and IE, the all forgiving-stimulating-bad-code-practice was the one that broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, the jQuery team quickly released an update and I have not experienced any bugs since. Keep it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

				<title>AjaxCFC for jQuery Alpha2 Release</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/1/15/AjaxCFC-for-jQuery-Alpha2-Release</link>
				<description>
				
				AjaxCFC for jQuery is almost ready and I just uploaded to &lt;a href="http://ajaxcfc.riaforge.org/" target="_blank"&gt;RIAForge&lt;/a&gt; the new Alpha 2 release. You may sync up your SVN repository or if you don't use source control, use RIAForge's zip download utility to fetch the latest version. Once you download the zip file, the jQuery related code is located in the branches/jquery folder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using the just released jQuery 1.1, so if you drop this code on an old site using jQuery, you probably want to download the back-compatibility plugin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I mentioned in my alpha 1 post, I included a plugin to maintain DWR syntax compatibility, and to illustrate it, I updated a few examples to use this code instead of DWR. Thus far, the only significant different I found is when returning a query using JSON serialization method (default on this release). The syntax to access the query columns is a little different, as you will see in the examples and soon-to-come documentation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among some other changes, I updated logging, error trapping, security checks, constructor methods, serialization capabilities, and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of these changes affect the DWR and jQuery version since the Ajax.cfc core file is shared between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Constructor method&lt;/span&gt;: many of you tried to extend your existing domain model objects and provide remote methods inside them. Although I don't particularly agree with this practice, I don't want to restrict it. AjaxCFC used to rely on it's built-in init method constructor, which interfered with you own component once extended, so I renamed the AjaxCFC to allow your objects to contain an init() method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Error trapping&lt;/span&gt;: AjaxCFC catches most errors in your components and by default, alert you with the error message. I added the file and line number since sometimes the message was not enough. I also added a method to optionally popup a window showing the error dump, which is extremely useful because you can see the full trace... to enable this just invoke the setPopupErrorDump(true) method inside your CFC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Security Check (for jQuery version only)&lt;/span&gt;: jQuery sends additional x-header data in the http request, so I added an option to check for it, to prevent access to the CFC if it's accessed by any method other than an XmlHttpRequest. To enable it just invoke the setCheckHttpRequestData(true) method inside your CFC. In fact, by default AjaxCFC ships with all the security methods turned off, for easier debugging. It is advisable to turn them on by calling: setAllowedVerbs('post'); setCheckHTTPReferer(true); setPopupErrorDump(false); setCheckHttpRequestData(true);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Serialization (for jQuery only)&lt;/span&gt;: The new AjaxCFC is able to serialize using pure JS, JSON, or WDDX. I haven't fully benchmarked the performance differences, so for now just use the one you like the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Logging&lt;/span&gt;: I updated the log4javascript version, plus I added a little more information in the request logs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Documentation will be included with the beta release.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that despite some comments out there, this release does not mean that AjaxCFC switched to jQuery. This release is a branch using a different Ajax engine, and both versions will continue to be updated and supported. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's it for now, please report any issues using &lt;a href="http://ajaxcfc.riaforge.org/index.cfm?event=page.issues" target="_blank"&gt;RIAForge's bug tracker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy.
