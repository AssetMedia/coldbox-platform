         <title>Our Flex Developer Derby entries</title>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;We submitted two entries for the &lt;a href="http://labs.adobe.com/showcase/special/flexderby/"&gt;Flex Developer Derby&lt;/a&gt;, which, for some reason, are not yet posted at Adobe Labs.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/projects/home-locator/" title="Home Locator"&gt;Home Locator&lt;/a&gt; is a complete revamp of our Real Estate sample application. We changed the functionality and included a Yahoo! Map that shows the property location. We actually didn&amp;#39;t use much of the old code and we focused much more on the usability and look and feel of the application. We spent an incredible amount of time during the design, not even doing actual code. Most of the hurdles we encountered were due to Yahoo! maps not wanting to behave and bugs in the Flex framework, specially when we wanted to skin the application, going away from the default halo (or whatever is called now) look. At the end, we are happy with the outcome. Before you ask, no, we are not planning to give the source away, at least not for now. We are, however, going to post the source for the original Real Estate application for the Beta 3 release.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We have no hopes of winning anything with the other application, &lt;a href="/projects/my-to-do-list/" title="My To-do List"&gt;My to-do list&lt;/a&gt;, since it does not compare to the other entries. It is really a very simple application, and it was developed as part of an article for the ColdFusion Developer Journal. So you can expect to see a step-by-step tutorial based on it and the complete source for download soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

         <title>Presenting Mango at the University of California, Irvine</title>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;I will present &lt;a href="http://www.mangoblog.org" title="Mango Blog"&gt;Mango&lt;/a&gt; and its accompanying paper at the &lt;a href="http://www.urop.uci.edu/symposium.html" title="UROP Symposium UCI"&gt;UROP Symposium&lt;/a&gt; at the University of California, Irvine this Saturday May 13. By looking at the &lt;a href="http://www.frappr.com/cfdevelopers"&gt;frappr&lt;/a&gt; map, I don&amp;#39;t think there are many CF developers around here in Orange County, but you don&amp;#39;t have to be a developer to attend since everybody is invited. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Presentation: 2:20 PM (Room 242)&lt;br /&gt; Poster Session: 1:00pm - 1:50pm&lt;br /&gt; Humanities Building&lt;br /&gt; University of California, Irvine&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Abstract&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Blogs have become a popular vehicle for communicating ideas, information sharing and journal publishing. Several blog &amp;quot;engines&amp;quot; are available that allow individual bloggers to get started with relative ease. Most engines are constrained to a specific implementation, for example using PHP and MySQL, or are otherwise unable to support the customization and extensibility expected by today&amp;#39;s bloggers. This paper describes the Mango project, addressing the above shortcomings by providing an open-source, extensible and customizable blog engine that uses and benefits from Adobe ColdFusion.&lt;br /&gt;Mango&amp;#39;s architecture is easily extended by the use of plugins, custom tags and interchangeable skins. In addition, most blog engines today do not provide full-text indexing of the content. Mango blog uses the built-in Verity indexing engine to allow full-text searches. Mango exposes administrative tasks in several popular formats, and syndication data in the form of RSS and ATOM feeds. Thus, the content of blog postings can be modified from a number of different clients and can be accessed by any RSS reader. Currently, Mango is used at UCI in a classroom environment for team communication and document publication. We plan to make it available for public download as soon as the initial tests have been passed. A demo and documentation can be found at http://www.mangoblog.org&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

         <title>EOLAS fix for ColdFusion Flash Forms</title>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;Adobe just released a new &lt;a href="http://www.dcooper.org/blog/client/index.cfm?mode=entry&amp;amp;entry=16A8DFE4-4E22-1671-512A5BF21E06787B" title="Damon Cooper's blog - ColdFusion Updater"&gt;ColdFusion MX 7 Updater&lt;/a&gt; that works with Flex 2 (beta 3). This updater also fixes the EOLAS problem. We've received a lot of questions about this issue and the answer is: don't worry, Adobe will care of it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, I highly recommend that you start playing with the new Flex2 (beta 3). It rocks :)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More info on Damon's &lt;a href="http://www.dcooper.org/blog/client/index.cfm?mode=entry&amp;amp;entry=16A8DFE4-4E22-1671-512A5BF21E06787B" title="Damon Cooper's blog"&gt;blog.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

         <title>CSSReboot: a new design</title>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;As many of you have noticed, we have changed the design. We did it for the &lt;a href="http://www.cssreboot.com/" title="CSSReboot"&gt;CSSReboot&lt;/a&gt; on May first.&lt;br /&gt; We spend a lot of time making it more usable and at the same time making it look nicer. I think it&amp;rsquo;s much better than what we previously had.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve just finished fixing some bugs and now it validates both XHTML and CSS (maybe same old pages break).&lt;br /&gt;But there are more bugs to fix, and we also need to retouch some old posts and finish the archives.&lt;br /&gt;The layout is pure CSS, no tables, and we are using some Ajax to preview the comments. I hope you like it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the way, we have a home page now :)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="update"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt;It looks like the guys from &lt;a href="http://www.cssremix.com/" title="CSSRemix"&gt;CSSRemix&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://cssmania.com/" title="CSSMania"&gt;CSSMania&lt;/a&gt; added As Fusion to their galleries, thanks ;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
