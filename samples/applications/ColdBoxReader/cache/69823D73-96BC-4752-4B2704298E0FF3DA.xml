		<title>37 Signals Launches Campfire</title>
		<description>Campfire, the new 37 Signals product, launched yesterday. It is a dead simple way to create a robust, permanent (with URL) group chat.

Key features include embedded images, permanent URL for chat, no client to download (chat is in the web page), and easy file sharing. I'm basically thinking of it ...</description>

		<title>Google Buys MeasureMap</title>
		<description>Google just announced that they have acquired Adaptive Path's Measure Map (one of my most loved companies, more posts on them here).

No word on price...my wild ass speculation is $5 - $10m. Measure Map has not raised outside capital, and seems to be more of a drain on Adaptive Path ...</description>
