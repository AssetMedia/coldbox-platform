				<title>ajaxCFC quick patch</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/8/30/ajaxCFC-quick-patch</link>
				<description>
				
				I just uploaded a small patch into &lt;a href="http://www.robgonda.com/blog/projects/ajaxcfc" target="_blank"&gt;ajaxCFC&lt;/a&gt; for the Model-Glue examples to work on the CFMX DevNet Edition. I had the core examples already patched, but I found that the MG were not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will release a major engine update within the next few days.

				<title>South Florida CFUG Reminder</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/8/30/South-Florida-CFUG-Reminder</link>
				<description>
				
				Quick reminder: I'll be speaking tomorrow at the &lt;a href="http://www.cfug-sfl.org/" target="_blank"&gt;South Florida CFUG&lt;/a&gt;. The session is on &lt;a href="http://www.model-glue.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Model-Glue&lt;/a&gt; and Unity. I will start with defining design patterns, implicit invocation, MVC, and then go into detail about the MG implementation: data flow, event handlers, listeners, models, views, ... To cover Unity I would probably need several hours, so I don't think I will get into scaffolding, and ColdSpring in details (autowiring, proxies, aop) ... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll post my slides tomorrow.

				<title>weird pages linking back</title>

				<description>
				
				Has anyone seen this type of crap before? Every single day I find new sites with dummy content mentioning my name/blog linking back ... What could be the reason for this? Traffic, clickthroughs, ad-sense? Does anyone else have this problem?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;e.g. these just came up last night&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://rajax.rafflesiapages.com/?p=36&lt;br /&gt;http://encleangreaseoffpansthe.blogspot.com/2006/08/clean-grease-off-pans_17.html&lt;br /&gt;http://howcleangreaseoffpanswith.blogspot.com/2006/08/clean-grease-off-pans_24.html&lt;br /&gt;http://whenasseenontvdoggierampto.blogspot.com/2006/08/as-seen-on-tv-doggie-ramp_24.html&lt;br /&gt;http://thecleangreaseor.blogspot.com/2006/08/clean-grease_25.html&lt;br /&gt;http://thisasseenontvdoggierampwhat.blogspot.com/2006/08/as-seen-on-tv-doggie-ramp_25.html

				<title>Ajax Debugging Tip</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/8/24/Ajax-Debugging-Tip</link>
				<description>
				
				Rey Bango posted a &lt;a href="http://www.reybango.com/index.cfm/2006/8/24/AjaxCFC-Debugging-Tip" target="_blank"&gt;nice entry&lt;/a&gt; to help debug Ajax calls. The problem people usually run into is that Ajax triggers a remote call in the background and they have no idea to see why it failed. ajaxCFC will show you the ColdFusion error, if any, but if the problem breaks to communication for some reason it will just say invalid reply from the server... but why?! I always tell people to install a nice http sniffer, and Rey confirms it.&lt;br /&gt;The moral of the story is: use &lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.com" target="_blank"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;, use &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1843/" target="_blank"&gt;FireBug&lt;/a&gt;.

				<title>little tip for model-glue: unity</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/8/23/little-tip-for-modelglue-unity</link>
				<description>
				
				If you're developing in Model-Glue:Unity, you may already know that you are working with ColdSpring and Reactor. ColdSpring may seem obvious because you set up all Model-Glue's properties with ColdSpring; as the matter of fact, Model-Glue is a ColdSpring application. &lt;br /&gt;However, Model-Glue also ties to Reactor, which you may decide to use or not. A little performance tip is to set Reactor to production mode if you're not using it, because whether you use it or not, it will take up resources. &lt;br /&gt;To chance it to production mode open ColdSpring.xml, find the reactorConfiguration bean, and modify the mode to &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&amp;lt;property name=&amp;quot;mode&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;value&amp;gt;production&amp;lt;/value&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/property&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still not sure exactly why it would make such a difference, but in the project I'm currently working, which does not use Reactor at all, it improved the load time from 700ms to 100ms, having Model-Glue set to always reload.

				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/8/17/Google-Analytics-Open-to-Everyone</link>
				<description>
				
				Google just removed the wait to receive a Google Analytics account. Now anyone with a website can instantly create one for free by simply by visiting &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/analytics" target="_blank"&gt;google.com/analytics&lt;/a&gt; or by clicking on the &amp;quot;Analytics&amp;quot; tab within AdWords.  After you create an account, they suggest reading the &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/support/analytics/bin/answer.py?answer=40932" target="_blank"&gt;Installation Guide&lt;/a&gt; to get it set up quickly and correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been using Google Analytics for a while and I like it a lot; the best part: it's free!

				<title>JavaScript Model-View-Controller with Dojo toolkit</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/8/8/JavaScript-ModelViewController-with-Dojo-toolkit</link>
				<description>
				
				You probably know how I love design patterns and apply them all over CF ... You also know I love Dojo :) ... I just found &lt;a href="http://www.alexatnet.com/Blog/Index/2006-08-04/javascript-model-view-controller-with-dojo-toolkit" target="_blank"&gt;this nice article&lt;/a&gt; showing how to apply MVC in JavaScript with Dojo. I don't extensively use JavaScript, but it's a nice implementation.

				<title>updated to blogcfc 5.1.004</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/8/8/updated-to-blogcfc-51004</link>
				<description>
				
				I just updated my blog from v5.004 to 5.1.004. I was reading in the blogsphere that this update was a bit of a hassle, or did not go smoothly for some people. In my case, so far so good (knock on wood). I just upgraded 5 mins ago and thus far nothing's broken. I backed up my entire 5.004 folder and overwrote everything with the new version; then I modified some custom files I have, such as application, layout, admin entry pages (fckeditor), ping rpc .. that's it ... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If someone notice something broken please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again Ray, you rock!&lt;br /&gt;

				<title>CFMX7 + W2k3sp1 = Access is denied</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/8/7/CFMX7--W2k3sp1--Access-is-denied</link>
				<description>
				
				I just can't believe there is no official documentation on this issue. If you ever tried to install ColdFusion MX7 on a Windows 2003 Server with sp1 pre installed, your ColdFusion will not install properly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just tried to install it over 20-30 times, changing settings, nt security, firewall, web server, jrun, man .. everything! I tried to install it on an AMD 64 bit CPU running Windows 2003 Server. The 64 bit threw me off, and I almost returned it and ordered a new system... the strange fact is that I have other AMD 64bits running ... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of the installation type, standalone, multiserver, using the built-in web server, iis, or apache, it will always finish the install with errors. If you look at the logs you will see 2 or 3 non-fatal errors:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ERROR - jrun.xmljava.io.FileNotFoundException: C:\JRun4\tmpmove.bat (Access is denied)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;or&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ERROR - jrun.xmljava.io.FileNotFoundException: C:\CFusionMX7\tmpmove.bat (Access is denied)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Web Server Connector Configuration Error&lt;br /&gt;Status: ERROR&lt;br /&gt;Additional Notes: ERROR - JNDI port 2902 for server cfusion is not active&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last one I don't have the exact error, but it was something along the line of cannot find C:\CFUsionMX7\lib&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Missing the entire /lib folder does not look so 'non-fatal' to me. Anyways, ColdFusion would not start. After trying everything known to man, I even tried to copy the /lib folder from another server.... nada, nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found two solutions to this problem:&lt;br /&gt;1) Reinstall sp1 on top of the pre-installed sp1.&lt;br /&gt;2) A little easier, and I still don't know why this works, install CF with the silent mode. Run the CF install file from a command line (DOS box) with &amp;quot;-f silent.properties&amp;quot; and it will take 2 mins to install. Silent.properties is a file that you must create using a text editor. See &lt;a href="http://www.macromedia.com/go/87bd20f4" target="_blank"&gt;this technote&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I installed it silently with the built-in server, and then manually attached the IIS connectors. It also installed the Report Builder, I guess it's part of the silent install... so I removed it after it was done. I kept a copy of the silent.properties if anyone needs it, but it's close to the template provided in the technote.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adobe should document this issue! Next time you're installing CFMX7 on a W2k3 box, remember this post, it may save you days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

				<title>SVNServe Vs Apache</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/8/2/SVNServe-Vs-Apache</link>
				<description>
				
				SVN, short for &lt;a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Subversion&lt;/a&gt;, is a source control system similar to CSV, but IMHO better. Anyways, it is extremely simple to install the server, for Windows or Linux servers. SVN will take care of versioning, but if you need to serve it over IP you must use an additional tool, SVNServe and Apache being the two main (only?) choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have to choose one, here are a few points to take into consideration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Both work with Windows and Linux&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;SVNServe for Windows allows to serve a single repository; SVNServe for Linux allows unlimited&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Apache allows to serve unlimited repositories in both OS.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://svn1clicksetup.tigris.org/" target="_blank"&gt;svn1clicks&lt;/a&gt; allows to fully install SVN + SVNServe in Windows&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;SVNServe runs on port 3690, Apache runs on port 80&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Apache allows to run encrypted SVN over HTTPS -- port 443&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Apache allows to authenticate against an htpassword file, ldap, or other methods. SVNServe uses a clear text passwd file.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;SVNServe and Apache allow per repository authentication, including None, R, or RW. Apache allows per folder access restrictions too.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Apache requires to restart/reload configuration everytime a change is made. SVNServe picks it up automatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Those are the main points I can think of right now, there may be more, so please share your personal experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two setups at the moment, one running SVN+SVNServe for Linux, and the other is SVN+Apache in a Windows box. In fact, this box is running IIS6 and Apache with no conflicts, which you can accomplish by either having multiple IPs, or assigning a special port for Apache. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My client tools are &lt;a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/" target="_blank"&gt;TortoiseSVN&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/" target="_blank"&gt;SubEclipse&lt;/a&gt;. I tried SVN Ant a couple of times, but I gave up... running SVN in the command line with Ant.

				<title>Yet Another ColdFusion Ajax Library</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/8/2/Yet-Another-ColdFusion-Ajax-Library</link>
				<description>
				
				Brian pointed me today to &lt;a href="http://www.indiankey.com/mxajax/index.cfm" target="_blank"&gt;mxAjax&lt;/a&gt;, yet another ColdFusion Ajax Library. After over a year of hiding in the dark, Arjun, the creator of CFAjax decided to discontinue that framework and start&amp;nbsp; a new project. &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&amp;quot;It is inspired from CFAjax but is build from grounds up&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, which actually means that there is a ColdFusion back end for prototype, scriptaculous, and rico front end. It must says, it's nicer than CFAjax, especially because of the similarity to AjaxCFC :) ... it posts to a CFC, that extends a base components that handles some core functionality like complex object translation. It uses the exact same code I do to get metadata from functions and invoke them using argument collection and named arguments.... Well, I chose to license it under Apache 2.0, so what the hell, hehe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mxAjax uses JSON as the standard complex object notation, and the cfjson udfs to serialize/deserialize. It's only version 1, and I would suggest a couple of improvements like ALWAYS VAR SCOPE, and don't throw unnecessary debugging information in the screen to later reset the content... it's a misuse of resources... in addition, it's forcing to abort the request after the JS is displayed, but what if I had additional cleanups and logging?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyways, Arjun, great improvement from CFAjax... nicely done ... btw, if you're reading this, please tell us why you chose prototype... I hope it wasn't bcuz of RoR :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

				<title>uploading a file via Ajax</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/8/1/uploading-a-file-via-Ajax</link>
				<description>
				
				It is not possible. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lol, well, ok.... the XMLHttpRequest cannot send multipart/form-data, therefore, cannot upload files. There are two ways around this:&lt;br /&gt;1) use an iframe. This can be transparent, e.g. using the dojo.io.bind &lt;a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/ajax-file-uploads-to-amazon-s3" target="_blank"&gt;will do it automatically&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;2) use a pixel Flash movie. You can create a 1 pixel flash movie, interface with it using the external interface (Flash 8 required), and use the Flash buffer classes (Flash 9 required) to upload the file. The nice thing about this is that you get the total bytes transferred count, thus you can display an accurate progress bar. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll try to post an example of both options soon.

				<title>Clearing template cache automatically</title>

				Brian Szoszorek &lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/coldfusion/articles/cacheclear.html" target="_blank"&gt;wrote an excellent article&lt;/a&gt; on clearing trusted cache automatically with even gateways -- directory watcher. &lt;br /&gt;Trusted cache should be enabled in every ColdFusion production server, as it prevents cfm,cfc files from being compiled into Java classes every time. ColdFusion will not check for file system updates, so you would have to clear cache every time you make a change. Brian proposed a solution to automate it via event gateways -- which only work for enterprise installs of course. Really nice I must say.
