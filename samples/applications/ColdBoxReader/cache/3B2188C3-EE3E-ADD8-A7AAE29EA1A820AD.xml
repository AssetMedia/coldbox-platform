				<title>subversion 1.4 is out</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/9/13/subversion-14-is-out</link>
				<description>
				
				&lt;a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Subversion 1.4&lt;/a&gt; was released a few days ago... I haven't upgraded my servers yet, but I will post comments as soon as I do. Why should you upgrade?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;svnsync&lt;/tt&gt;, a new repository mirroring tool&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Huge working-copy performance improvements&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Support for BerkeleyDB 4.4 and its &amp;quot;auto recovery&amp;quot; feature&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Size improvements to the binary delta algorithm&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A handful of new command switches&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Many improved APIs&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;More than 40 new bugfixes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Tortoise SVN&lt;/a&gt; is still on 1.4 RC1, so we should be seeing the final release soon. &lt;a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Subeclipse&lt;/a&gt; shows no signs of adding the new commands to the client.

				<title>Atlas renamed and works with ColdFusion</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/9/11/Atlas-renamed-and-works-with-ColdFusion</link>
				<description>
				
				&lt;p&gt;Scott Guthrie has announced the &lt;a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/09/11/_2200_Atlas_2200_-1.0-Naming-and-Roadmap.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Atlas&amp;rdquo; 1.0 Naming and Roadmap&lt;/a&gt; that as part of releasing &amp;ldquo;Atlas&amp;rdquo;, they have also finally locked on an official set of product names that they will begin using moving forward. What was formerly called &amp;ldquo;Atlas&amp;rdquo; will now have a few names:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The client-side &amp;ldquo;Atlas&amp;rdquo; javascript library is going to be called the Microsoft AJAX Library. This will work with any browser, and also support any backend web server (read these blog posts to see how to run it on &lt;a href="http://www.shankun.com/Atlas_Php_2.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;PHP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/archive/2006/06/29/649944.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;ColdFusion&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The server-side &amp;ldquo;Atlas&amp;rdquo; functionality that nicely integrates with ASP.NET will be called the ASP.NET 2.0 AJAX Extensions. As part of this change the tag prefix for the &amp;ldquo;Atlas&amp;rdquo; controls will change from &lt;atlas&gt;to &lt;asp&gt;. These controls will also be built-in to ASP.NET vNext.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/asp&gt;&lt;/atlas&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Atlas&amp;rdquo; Control Toolkit today is a set of free, shared source controls and components that help you get the most value from the ASP.NET AJAX Extensions. Going forward, the name of the project will change to be the ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Microsoft demonstrated Atlas at CFUnited, and ... well, it wasn't pretty ... Anyways, you can't judge a technology by a bad presentation... I've seen it before, and Atlas is pretty powerful... it's a very well structured library and will probably get a large chunk of marketshare.... It's broken down into two pieces: server side and client side. The combination it's nice, but they're trying to push their JavaScript library and show how it can be used with any server side language... of course it can, so does Rico, Prototype, Dojo, DWR, and a few hundreds... If you wish to give it a try, Microsoft shared the code they used at CFUnited with ColdFusion...

				<title>cfQuickDocs has its own domain now</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/9/11/cfQuickDocs-has-its-own-domain-now</link>
				<description>
				
				&lt;a href="http://www.techfeed.net/cfQuickDocs/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.techfeed.net/cfQuickDocs/&lt;/a&gt; is now &lt;a href="http://www.cfquickdocs.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.cfquickdocs.com/&lt;/a&gt;. It definitely deserved its own domain. I've got this page aliased a CF in Firefox and use it, almost every day.... especially cuz Eclipse does not have this documentation built in like old homesite used to, so I recur to this site all the time. It's faster that the MM/Adobe docs by the factor of at least 10x or 20x.... bookmark it CF community, it's worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How about a plugin for eclipse now Yacob?

				<title>ajaxCFC in Ajax Books</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/9/10/ajaxCFC-in-Ajax-Books</link>
				<description>
				
				&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/ajaxdp/"&gt;Oreilly's Ajax Design Patterns&lt;/a&gt; has a list of Ajax/ColdFusion frameworks on page 585 and it lists ajaxCFC. It says &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Restricted open source license (free to use in any context but not redistributable) by Rob Gonda.&lt;/span&gt; which used to be the case, but the &lt;a href="http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/2/21/ajaxCFC-License-change"&gt;license changed&lt;/a&gt; in February 2006. The book came out in June, so it is understandable that the information was a little outdated... this is what happens with every book on cutting-edge technology .. but the time it's published, some/most/any of the covered topics could have changed, or the is a new, better, or improved way of doing things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talking about books, my &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.realworldajaxbook.com/"&gt;Real-World Ajax book&lt;/a&gt; should had come out a few months ago, but due to delays in x,y,z it will come out next month, during the AjaxWorld Conference. It's a nice book, but I wish it had come out a while back as planned... just like I said, it may be missing some of the new tendencies that came out in the last 6 months; nevertheless, it covers all the basics, intermediate, and many advanced topics, and includes many examples in many different languages...

				<title>Annoying invalidtag appearing from nowhere</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/9/10/Annoying-invalidtag-appearing-from-nowhere</link>
				<description>
				
				So lately I ran into this problem where my CMS was converting Flash embed tags into invalidtags and it drove me crazy ... I initially blamed the fckeditor, but when I tried to update my DB with a plain textarea and it did the same I realized the problem must be either in the DB or in my drivers... For those of you who haven't experienced this yet, every time you submit text content to be saved in the db, and 'script', 'embed', and probably many other tags will be automatically replaced by 'invalidtag' tags.... so my clients were uploading swfs, and it kept breaking. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally found the problem... ColdFusion has an option in the admin:&amp;nbsp; Enable Global Script Protection, which I guess after the 7.0.2 update started blocking embed tags coming from form posts. I'm not sure how much protection it provides me since I'm usually pretty good validating all my data, but this fact alone made me turn it off in every development and production server.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now you know, if you start seeing invalidtag's appearing randomly, just disable the global script protection ...

				<title>blogcfc and isapi rewrite</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/9/10/blogcfc-and-isapi-rewrite</link>
				<description>
				
				I've been thinking about doing this for the longest time, but I finally got around to add some non-blog content to my site... I added a basic bio (copy/paste from linked-in), my agenda with this year's presentations (will add links and downloads soon), and a flex app with community jobs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the idea of managing my content from the back-end, so I'm using the page editor from blogCFC, slightly modified to use the fckeditor instead of a plain textarea. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also didn't like the page.cfm SES ... while it's better than straight up dynamic urls, I'd like them to be cleaner, so I'm using isapi rewrite. I would love to use it for all my links, but after a year of blogging over 500 pages indexed at google I'm not sure it's a good idea... thoughts? should I rewrite my urls and leave both working for a while? this will affect the age of my content ... any expert out there?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

				<title>ajaxCFC utils update</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/9/10/ajaxCFC-utils-update</link>
				<description>
				
				I just updated ajaxCFC with a massively refactored utils class, including highlight handler, improved form serialization, debugging, and the ability to use image loading indicators (brought to you by &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.reybango.com/index.cfm/2006/8/16/Adding-an-Ajax-Indicator-Image-in-AjaxCFC"&gt;Rey Bango&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to use the image loading indicator use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;DWRUtil.useLoadingImage(&amp;quot;/images/ajax-loader.gif&amp;quot;); &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;You may find a bunch of indicators at &lt;a href="http://www.ajaxload.info/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ajaxload.info/&lt;/a&gt;

				<title>ColdFusion and Flex: Do you need Flex Data Services?</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/9/9/ColdFusion-and-Flex-Do-you-need-Flex-Data-Services</link>
				<description>
				
				Adobe Flex 2 has been out for a couple of months now, and lots of ColdFusion customers are discovering that the combination of ColdFusion and Flex allows them to deliver powerful and engaging applications easier than ever before.
&lt;p&gt; One area of confusion appears to be the Adobe Flex server: Adobe Flex Data Services. What is Adobe Flex Data Services? What exactly does Flex Data Services allow you to do that you wouldn't be able to do without it? What does this mean specifically to us ColdFusion developers? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Ben Forta's new article Adobe Developer Center article entitled &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/coldfusion/articles/fr_fds.html"&gt;ColdFusion and Flex: Do you need Flex Data Services?&lt;/a&gt; explains. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Ajax for ColdFusion Developers Breeze Presso next week</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/9/6/Ajax-for-ColdFusion-Developers-Breeze-Presso-next-week</link>
				<description>
				
				I'll be presenting Ajax for ColdFusion Developers to both the &lt;a href="http://www.bostoncfug.org/" target="_blank"&gt;local Boston CFUG&lt;/a&gt; and also the &lt;a href="http://coldfusion.meetup.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Online ColdFusion Meetup Group&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The event detail for the OCFMG is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://coldfusion.meetup.com/17/events/5113555/" target="_blank"&gt;http://coldfusion.meetup.com/17/events/5113555/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was tempted to use the same pressos I have at the Ajax World Conference, but I think I may change it up a bit and add some opinions about Spry, Ajax Vs. Flex, ColdFusion Frameworks, and then some... I want this not to be another Ajax presentation, but something that clears up doubts in the community ... if you have any specific topics you want me to cover, there is still time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you all there.

				<title>ajaxCFC: more small fixes</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/9/6/ajaxCFC-more-small-fixes</link>
				<description>
				
				just uploaded a new release of AjaxCFC with a couple of fixes:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;backwards compatibility for single arguments with an object, provided by nathanael waite. You may add the setComplexInputStruct(boolean) to the top of your function to enable or disable allowing argumentCollections to be passed to ajaxCFC. If enabled and a single object is passed as an arguments, it will be threaded as a collection. This is enabled by default.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;fix in the argumentCollection option mentioned above to allow passing a single array argument. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
More to come soon.

				<title>ajaxCFC quick patch</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/8/30/ajaxCFC-quick-patch</link>
				<description>
				
				I just uploaded a small patch into &lt;a href="http://www.robgonda.com/blog/projects/ajaxcfc" target="_blank"&gt;ajaxCFC&lt;/a&gt; for the Model-Glue examples to work on the CFMX DevNet Edition. I had the core examples already patched, but I found that the MG were not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will release a major engine update within the next few days.

				<title>South Florida CFUG Reminder</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/8/30/South-Florida-CFUG-Reminder</link>
				<description>
				
				Quick reminder: I'll be speaking tomorrow at the &lt;a href="http://www.cfug-sfl.org/" target="_blank"&gt;South Florida CFUG&lt;/a&gt;. The session is on &lt;a href="http://www.model-glue.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Model-Glue&lt;/a&gt; and Unity. I will start with defining design patterns, implicit invocation, MVC, and then go into detail about the MG implementation: data flow, event handlers, listeners, models, views, ... To cover Unity I would probably need several hours, so I don't think I will get into scaffolding, and ColdSpring in details (autowiring, proxies, aop) ... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll post my slides tomorrow.

				<title>weird pages linking back</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/8/25/weird-pages-linking-back</link>
				<description>
				
				Has anyone seen this type of crap before? Every single day I find new sites with dummy content mentioning my name/blog linking back ... What could be the reason for this? Traffic, clickthroughs, ad-sense? Does anyone else have this problem?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;e.g. these just came up last night&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://rajax.rafflesiapages.com/?p=36&lt;br /&gt;http://encleangreaseoffpansthe.blogspot.com/2006/08/clean-grease-off-pans_17.html&lt;br /&gt;http://howcleangreaseoffpanswith.blogspot.com/2006/08/clean-grease-off-pans_24.html&lt;br /&gt;http://whenasseenontvdoggierampto.blogspot.com/2006/08/as-seen-on-tv-doggie-ramp_24.html&lt;br /&gt;http://thecleangreaseor.blogspot.com/2006/08/clean-grease_25.html&lt;br /&gt;http://thisasseenontvdoggierampwhat.blogspot.com/2006/08/as-seen-on-tv-doggie-ramp_25.html

				<title>Ajax Debugging Tip</title>
				<link>http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/8/24/Ajax-Debugging-Tip</link>
				<description>
				
				Rey Bango posted a &lt;a href="http://www.reybango.com/index.cfm/2006/8/24/AjaxCFC-Debugging-Tip" target="_blank"&gt;nice entry&lt;/a&gt; to help debug Ajax calls. The problem people usually run into is that Ajax triggers a remote call in the background and they have no idea to see why it failed. ajaxCFC will show you the ColdFusion error, if any, but if the problem breaks to communication for some reason it will just say invalid reply from the server... but why?! I always tell people to install a nice http sniffer, and Rey confirms it.&lt;br /&gt;The moral of the story is: use &lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.com" target="_blank"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;, use &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1843/" target="_blank"&gt;FireBug&lt;/a&gt;.
