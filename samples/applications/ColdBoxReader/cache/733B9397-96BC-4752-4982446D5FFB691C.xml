				<title>More Code Generator Updates - Oracle Support</title>
				<link>http://www.remotesynthesis.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/9/10/Code-Generator-Updates--Oracle-Support</link>
				<description>
				
				I have just committed new changes to the Illudium PU-36 Code Generator that add Oracle support. As I know nothing about Oracle, this code was generously donated by Beth Bowden, so I want to send her a special thank you.

She also made some suggestions for the generated code, one of which I have already implemented as it will improve Oracle and MySQL support. I do need people who are interested in utlizing the Oracle support to let me know the outcome of their testing.

Lastly, if you are using the code generator and have made your own custom methods or modified the prebuilt generated code, feel free to contribute those for possible inclusion in future updates. I would love to see the project contain alternate component code for users to choose as the point of this was in large part to make it extremely easy to customize.

The project can be found (and downloaded via Subversion) at http://code.google.com/p/cfcgenerator/.

				<title>Code Generator Updates</title>
				<link>http://www.remotesynthesis.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/9/8/Code-Generator-Updates</link>
				<description>
				
				I have updated the Illudium PU-36 Code Generator ("Where's the Kaboom? There should have been an earth shattering kaboom."). There are a number of bug fixes that have been added in the since I launched it. The major change in the recent update is that the mssql queries have been totally rewritten to *hopefully* fix incompatibility issues with changes in MS SQL Server 2005. I do not actually have 2005, so I am hoping for testers in the community to assist. You can download the latest version via Subversion by browsing the product page at http://code.google.com/p/cfcgenerator/. If everything is ok, maybe we can call this version 0.5. I am hoping to overhaul the UI as a next step. Also, if anyone would like to add database support outside of the included MySQL and MS SQL, please contact me. It really isn't very difficult, but I don't have experience outside of the included dbs.

				<title>What's New In Mach ii 1.1.1 Presentation Recording</title>
				<link>http://www.remotesynthesis.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/8/29/Whats-New-In-Mach-ii-111-Presentation-Recording</link>
				<description>
				
				Matt Woodward and Peter Farrell presented today on "What's New in Mach ii 1.1.1" via Breeze. It was a great presentation, and Peter finally got to reveal the "secret" new feature which is application.cfc support. This will now give you access to onSessionStart/End(), onApplicationStart/End(), etc. Personally, I am already curious about using this feature since I was getting pretty comfortable using application.cfc before I started using frameworks. For anyone interested who missed the Breezo, you can view the recording here (note: there was some audio difficulty in the middle of the recording, but it was brief, so bear with it). Thanks to both Peter and Matt not only for this presentation, but also for all their hard work updating Mach ii.

As a side note, I am hoping to host further presentations on open-source projects like this one in the near future. If you are an author of an open-source project and are interested in presenting via Breeze, please contact me.

				<title>ColdFusion Open-Source Update - August 28</title>
				<link>http://www.remotesynthesis.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/8/28/ColdFusion-OpenSource-Update--August-28</link>
				<description>
				
				This was a busy week. A new beta of Mach ii was released and we added another 3 new open-source projects: Wininfo, gCal and Kalendar (funny there wasn't even a calendar category on the open-source list before two weeks ago and suddenly there are 3 projects in there).

Speaking of the list, I am moving along with a wholesale rewrite of it (built with mach ii and coldspring). In part this will be the first step to adding a bunch of new features. It is also a rework of the user interface. Along the user interface lines, I hope to post a "preview" (read - work in progress) sometime perhaps this week to get some feedback.

				<title>What's New In Mach ii 1.1.1 Breeze Presentation</title>
				<link>http://www.remotesynthesis.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/8/24/Whats-New-In-Mach-ii-111-Breeze-Presentation</link>
				<description>
				
				As part of the Adobe Community Experts program I get a Breeze account. I am hoping to use this to feature presentations regarding open-source projects. The first of the presentations along these lines will be "What's New in Mach ii 1.1.1" featuring presenters Matt Woodward and Peter Farrell.

Matt and Peter have recently released the 1.1.1 update into beta which despite its not being a full point release, actually has some nice updates and new features. The presentation will be at 1pm EST on Tuesday, August 29th.

Please RSVP for the presentation by commenting on this blog post. Unfortunately, at this time, the Breeze account I have is limited to 15 people. So, unless that changes, I will have to limit live attendance to the first RSVPs (I am hoping to have this changed soon...if not, hopefully for future presos). Nonetheless, I will post a recording URL when the preso is done.

The presentation URL is http://experts.breezecentral.com/remotesynth/.

				<description>
				
				Bet ya thought I'd be late this week... Another week of new projects - 3 to be exact: Vivio Calendar, BlogCFC Atom and Sean's REST adapter. Keep 'em coming!

On a side-note, I have joined the CFDJ editorial board with a focus on promoting ColdFusion open-source projects (though my bio is conspicuously absent from the board page). Feel free to share any ideas with me on how I can best achieve that ends through CFDJ.

				<title>Samuel Rinaldi born August 17th</title>
				<link>http://www.remotesynthesis.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/8/17/Samuel-Rinaldi-born-August-17th</link>
				<description>
				
				My 2nd son, Samuel Efrain Rinaldi, was born at 12:00am last night weighing 6 pounds 9 ounces and with a very healthy cry :) Interestingly, he got his own birthday by a matter of seconds as my birhtday was yesterday and my wife's is tomorrow. If you want to see pictures, I will post to my Flickr account or on my about me page shortly (neither of which I have done a good job of maintaining I admit). I will also be doing my best to keep up with the open-source updates and lists the next couple weeks, but at least you might understand why I might fall behind.

				<description>
				
				Another active week with few of the usual suspects. In fact, once again there are several new projects to announce including FlexMon, CodeCop, ColdSparx and some Red Ballon Labs projects. It is great to see the ColdFusion open source community growing rapidly, but man you guys are gonna eat up my Mondays so keep it at a measured pace ;) I need to add a few items to the list, but I will be listing over 120 projects, which is awesome considering that the original blog post back in december had less than 80 I believe...and also taking into account a considerable growth in new projects lately.

				<title>Getting Started with Subclipse</title>
				<link>http://www.remotesynthesis.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/8/10/Getting-Started-with-Subclipse</link>
				<description>
				
				This is a help document I created for my coworkers on using Subclipse, but it may be helpful to others who are just getting started with Subclipse and Subversion. I have been using Subclipse for some time now, but I wouldn't necessarily consider myself an expert by any means. So, any Subclipse experts out there, please feel free to post your tips, corrections and/or advice.

Subclipse is a plugin for the Eclipse IDE that allows you to interact with your Subversion repositories using a visual IDE (as opposed to the standard svn command-line). It can be downloaded at http://subclipse.tigris.org.

				<title>Objects and Frameworks - The Right Framework</title>
				<link>http://www.remotesynthesis.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/8/9/Objects-and-Frameworks--The-Right-Framework</link>
				<description>
				
				Inevitably when discussing getting started with frameworks, the question comes up, "Which framework should I choose?" Well, let's answer that.

You see, many years ago 4 frameworks were created and given to the gurus of ColdFusion OO. Then forged in the depths of Mordor was created the one framework to rule them all; one framework that could unleash the full power of ColdFusion. That framework was called...

				<title>ColdFusion Open-Source Update - August 7</title>
				<link>http://www.remotesynthesis.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/8/7/ColdFusion-OpenSource-Update--August-7</link>
				<description>
				
				Definitely not the usual suspects this week. We actually have a handful of new projects to discuss (including my own) and some general updates. Honestly, with all the releases happening lately, I am strongly in need of revamping the list - with 118 projects now and counting, it is getting a bit unwieldy as a just a huge list (granted you can filter, but by default you view all). However, this is a great problem to have; it seems like there is certainly no shortage of ColdFusion developers willing to share with the community.

				<title>New Open-Source Component Generator</title>
				<link>http://www.remotesynthesis.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/8/3/New-OpenSource-Component-Generator</link>
				<description>
				
				Many months back, I wrote a post showing you how to create your own code generator using XSL stylesheets and the admin API for database introspection. There were a couple of issues with it: 1) the generated code sucked (hey, I was very new to the OO stuff) 2) it wasn't very extensible as everything was handled through a single template. Since then, I have had the opportunity to update the generator and am finally releasing it as the Illudium PU-36 Code Generator (any Looney Tunes fans out there?) as a new open-source project under an Apache 2.0 license. You can download the code via the Subversion repository by going here (note: I plan to have a project page on this site soon). Keep in mind, this is alpha software, so there are likely bugs in there.

				<title>Avoiding eval() and iif()</title>
				<link>http://www.remotesynthesis.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/8/2/Avoiding-eval-and-iif</link>
				<description>
				
				I am not sure if I have posted this before (I am sure others have), but I thought I might mention a simple tip that doesn't seem obvious at all. Basically, you can put simple statements between pound signs and they will get evaluated. For instance, I used to do something like this in my queryparam's:





However, I have changed - and simplified - that to:





The "not len()" gets evaluated to true if the item has a length of 0 or false if it has any value other than empty string without the need for the iif statement or even an eval statement.

This is the most useful (to me) aspect of this "shortcut," but you can also do things like this:





Notice that the content of the file attribute does the string concatenation within a single set of pound signs. Yes, this only saves a few keystrokes, but I also find it easier to read (I've always found that the pound signs can clutter a page personally).

I would say that I have no idea if there are any negative performance consequences involved here (either positive or negative) since I haven't tested for that (in the places I have used this, if there were I didn't notice them)...plus if I got into that, Peter Bell might get on me about the dangers of "premature optimization." ;)
