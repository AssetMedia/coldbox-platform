Welcome to the ColdBox Samples Gallery.

This is small app, of course powered by ColdBox, that displays some of the sample
applications I have created and some of them are re-writes of FAMOUS open source projects
that I credit below.  

If you have ported an app to ColdBox or have an application you would like to share 
with the ColdBox community.  Please email me at lmajano@gmail.com with your application
so I can include it in the downloads section and the main release.

Installation
*******************************************************
In order to make the samples gallery functional you will need to do the following:

1) Copy the samples folder to your CFMX server.
2) Create a CFMX mapping to the samples folder path you just copied to the CFMX server called "coldboxSamples".
3) Browse to the samples directory on your browser and that is it.
