<h1>Release Notes &amp; Change Log</h1>
<h2><br />
  Version 0.9.X (June 2006)</h2>

  rewrite of the app from my TeXtus framework that I developed last year for <br />
  private use.</p>
<h2>Version 1.0.0 (July 5, 2006)</h2>
<p>- First public beta version</p>
<h2>Version 1.0.1 (July 10, 2006)</h2>
<p>- Fixes for ApplicationStartHandler.</p>
<h2>Version 1.0.2 (July 2006)</h2>
<p>- CustomHandler receives the ExceptionBean via the request collection.<br />

<h2>Version 1.1.0 (October 2006) CODENAME: JOHN 3:16</h2>
<p>- Varscoper Checks, Code Optimization and cleanup.<br />
  - Global Server Installation Method.<br />
  - CFMX 6.X &amp; BlueDragon are now fully Supported.<br />
  - Datasources support via config.xml. You can now use the getDatasource(&quot;name&quot;) in the<br />
  event handlers/plugins to retrieve a datsource bean.<br />
  - Mail Settings bean support. You can now use the getMailSettings() to retreive it.<br />
  - Messagebox.render(clearFlag) now has a clearFlag in order to clear or not, the message <br />
  structure after rendering.<br />
  - Eventhandler.cfc code optimization, no longer need of writing an init method. <br />
  PLEASE REMOVE THEM unless you have any code that needs to be executed every time<br />
  an event is called. Look at:<br />
  http://ortus.svnrepository.com/coldbox/trac.cgi/wiki/cbEventHandlersGuide<br />
  - Renderview can now accept a view name as a parameter. You can then render a view <br />
  anywhere you want, layouts, within views, event handlers, etc, and as content variables.<br />
  renderView(&quot;myTags/main_menu&quot;)<br />
  - New Plugins: FileWriter &amp; StringBuffer<br />
  - Framework/Application extensions via custom plugins, declared in config.xml.cfm<br />
  - Coldbox Logging Facilities: ColdBox now provides you with a per application <br />
  logging facility for errors and custom (error|fatal|information|warning) entries by <br />
  simplify filling out two settings in your config.xml and using the logger plugin.<br />
  - Event Handlers/Plugins now have a &quot;rc&quot; scope available, that is a direct line to the request collection.<br />
  - New Method: paramValue(&quot;var name&quot;,&quot;default&quot;) same as cfparam but for the request collection.<br />
  - cfcViewer plugin was revised. You can now use it to render documentation with any<br />
  stylesheet.<br />
  - New i18n and Resource Bundles Plugins based on Paul Hastings work.<br />

  - New Method: getSettingStructure( structure, deep_copy_flag ) Retrieves the entire configStruct<br />
  or the fwSettingsStructure.<br />
  - Mapping of Exception Types: http://ortus.svnrepository.com/coldbox/trac.cgi/wiki/cbExceptionsList<br />
  - Check out the latest API: http://www.coldboxframework.com/documents/cfdocs/index.cfm<br />
  - New Dashboard (Will be release later)<br />
  - Eclipse Snippets<br />
  - New sample applications: i18n Gallery, samples gallery, coldboxreader, Illidium CFC Generator</p>
<h2>Version 2.0.0 ( April 28, 2007 ) CODENAME: JOHN 4:14</h2>
<p>- License change to the Apache License, Version 2.0<br />
  - New RequestContext bus. This is in order to enable caching and encapsulation of the <br />
  request collection. Please see the compatibility guide. Your 1.1.0 and below code <br />
  will have to be modified slightly to accomodate this. All event handler methods receive the <br />
  requestContext bus object as an argument called 'event'.The object is also called 'event', <br />
  for the layouts/views.<br />
  <br />
  - Addition of new Application Settings: <br />
  - ReinitPassword: used to protect the fwreinit flag. Usage: fwreinit=password<br />
  - onInvalidEvent: write the event to execute when an invalid event is detected, ehGeneral.dspHome<br />
  - HandlerCaching: The framework will now cache your event handlers in application scope.<br />
  Please turn off in development. This is also an intelligent cache. Look at documentation.<br />
  - IOCFramework: You can now declare which framework you are using: coldspring or lightwire. <br />
  - IOCDefinitionFile: Here is where you declare the configuration file to load onAppInit in conjunction<br />
  with the IOCFramework declared.<br />
  - AppMapping setting is now optional, if not set, framework auto calculates.<br />
  - Deprecation of the AppDevMapping settings.<br />
  - Addition of Complex Settings to the config.xml for Arrays and Structures<br />
  - Arrays use [ ] notation: [1,2,3,4,5]<br />
  - Structures use { } notation: {name:luis,country:el salvador,state:california}</p>
<p>- Two new implicit methods for event handlers: PreHandler/PostHandler. If you create these methods<br />
  in your handlers, then the framework will execute them accordingly.</p>
<p>- Addition of an 'alias' property to the Datasource element, this is the alias to your name (dsn).<br />
  This is a mandatory property so please update your XML.<br />
  &lt;Datasource alias=&quot;blog_dsn&quot; name=&quot;myblog&quot; dbtype=&quot;oracle&quot; /&gt;<br />
  <br />
  - Addition of 'getHash()' method to your handlers and plugins. This will retrieve the unique<br />
  UUID of the created instance.</p>
<p>- Coldbox OCM (Object Cache Manager) : A facility for in-memory caching. This facility caches your<br />
  event handlers, plugins, custom plugins and anything you want. Look at API for usage.<br />
  - The framework has a reap frequency in which once every cycle,<br />
  the framework will remove objects from the cache that have expired. This way, reaping is<br />
  not performed on every request. A great way to balance cache access and reaping.<br />
  Change in the framework's settings.xml<br />
  - Metadata settings for caching for custom plugins and handlers via the cfcomponent tag:<br />
  &lt;cfcomponent name=&quot;handler&quot; extends=&quot;coldbox.system.eventhandler&quot; cache=&quot;true&quot; cachetimeout=&quot;500&quot;&gt;<br />
  The cachetimeout is in minutes. The cache flag is by default set to true if not set. So if you do not set it <br />
  explicitly to false, the framework will cache it at the default framework's timeout.<br />
  - Cache settings override via config.xml.cfm, please see wiki config guide.<br />
  - Plugins: <br />
  - Beanfactory.cfc - Addition of the populateBean method. It can now populate a named or instantiated<br />
  bean from the request collection. Great for setting a bean with form data. <br />
  It follows the bean contract, thanks to Sanah Ullah<br />
  - FileUtilities.cfc - new methods: getJVMFreeMemory(), getJVMTotalMemory(), isCFUUID()<br />
  - IOC.cfc - Added Inversion Of Control support via coldspring or lightwire.<br />
  Coldspring is the only one supported now. Lightwire will be added in the next version.<br />
  - sessionstorage.cfc - New facade plugin to use session scope for permanent values<br />
  - renderer.cfc: renderExternalview(). Will render an external view. Any<br />
  type of view: js,gif,etc.<br />
  - queryHelper.cfc - New plugin to help you sort and filter queries.<br />
  - timer.cfc - New plugin to help you time your code.<br />
  - New argument to plugin factory: NewInstance it will create a new instance<br />
  of the specified plugin. <br />
  <br />
  - New debugging Panel with object Cache Monitor<br />
  - Tons of bug fixes, look at trac site.<br />
  - Sample Applications:<br />
  - Updated the entire Illidium CFC Generator by Brian Rinaldi. (Pre Flex)<br />
  - Galleon Forums updated to version 1.7.008<br />
  - ColdBoxReader now moved to a service architecture using ColdSpring and ColdBox new <br />
  IOC plugin.<br />

  for all your handlers due to ColdBox's new event registration system.<br />

  compiled layouts.<br />
  - New eclipse snippets.<br />
  - Refactoring and code optimization.<br />
