Unit Testing for Event Handlers

The following test cases have been created for testing of event handlers, please
note that the controller created is the ColdBox's testcontroller.

The code speaks for itself. Just make sure you tests inherit from the base test
that can be found at coldbox.system.extras.baseTest

Structure:
AllTests.cfc - Test Suite for all test cases
cases/ehGeneralTest.cfc - The test case for the ehGeneral.cfc handler
cases/ehMaintTest.cfc - The test case for the ehMain.cfc handler
