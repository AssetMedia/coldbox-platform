You then use the ColdBox framework by including it from the index.cfm, look at the Application template's index file.ex: <cfinclude template="/coldbox/system/coldbox.cfm">This goes also for the extends property of your event handlers too: coldbox.system.eventhandlerYou can log in to the ColdBox Dashboardby going to your web server and the following address:http://{localhost}/coldbox/system/dashboard/index.cfmDefault Password: coldbox.The readme.txt in the Application Template folder gives you an in depth overviewof how to configure your first ColdBox application.******************************************************************************SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS******************************************************************************- ColdFusion MX 6.X and above- BlueDragon 6.2.1- Application Scope for the Frameworks internal structures & i18N support.
