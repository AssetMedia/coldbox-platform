Below is the one server install method.You need to extract the ColdBox distribution file and place it on your web root:Windows IIS:[DRIVE]:\inetpub\wwwroot\coldbox*nix:/{web root}/coldboxCFMX/BlueDragon/Ralio Standalone Server{Install_Folder}/wwwroot/coldboxOr wherever you web root resides. You then use the ColdBox framework by including it from the index.cfm, look at the Application template's index file and readme.txtex: <cfinclude template="/coldbox/system/coldbox.cfm">This goes also for the extends property of your event handlers too: coldbox.system.eventhandlerYou can log in to the ColdBox Dashboard, if you downloaded the bundle,by going to your web server and the following address:http://{localhost}/coldbox/dashboard/index.cfmDefault Password: coldbox.The readme.txt in the Application Template folder gives you an in-depth overviewof how to configure your first ColdBox application.********************************************************************************SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS********************************************************************************- ColdFusion MX 6.X and above- BlueDragon 6.2.1- Railo 2.0- Application Scope for the Frameworks internal structures & i18N support.

You can now use the getDatasource("name") in the  event handlers/plugins to retrieve a datsource bean.- Mail Settings bean support. You can now use the getMailSettings() to retreive it.- Messagebox.render(clearFlag) now has a clearFlag in order to clear or not, the message   structure after rendering.- Eventhandler.cfc code optimization, no longer need of writing an init method.   PLEASE REMOVE THEM unless you have any code that needs to be executed every time  an event is called. Look at:  http://ortus.svnrepository.com/coldbox/trac.cgi/wiki/cbEventHandlersGuide- Renderview can now accept a view name as a parameter. You can then render a view   anywhere you want, layouts, within views, event handlers, etc, and as content variables.  renderView("myTags/main_menu")- New Plugins: FileWriter & StringBuffer- Framework/Application extensions via custom plugins, declared in config.xml.cfm- Coldbox Logging Facilities: ColdBox now provides you with a per application   logging facility for errors and custom (error|fatal|information|warning) entries by   simplify filling out two settings in your config.xml and using the logger plugin.- Event Handlers/Plugins now have a "rc" scope available, that is a direct line to the request collection.- New Method: paramValue("var name","default") same as cfparam but for the request collection.- cfcViewer plugin was revised. You can now use it to render documentation with any  stylesheet.- New i18n and Resource Bundles Plugins based on Paul Hastings work.- ATTESORO JAVA RESOURCE BUNDLES UTILITY IS INCLUDED.- New Method: getSettingStructure( structure, deep_copy_flag ) Retrieves the entire configStruct  or the fwSettingsStructure.- Mapping of Exception Types: http://ortus.svnrepository.com/coldbox/trac.cgi/wiki/cbExceptionsList- Check out the latest API: http://www.coldboxframework.com/documents/cfdocs/index.cfm- New Dashboard (Will be release later)- Eclipse Snippets- New sample applications: i18n Gallery, samples gallery, coldboxreader, Illidium CFC GeneratorVersion 2.0.0 ( April 28, 2007 ) CODENAME: JOHN 4:14- License change to the Apache License, Version 2.0- New RequestContext bus. This is in order to enable caching and encapsulation of the   request collection. Please see the compatibility guide. Your 1.1.0 and below code   will have to be modified slightly to accomodate this. All event handler methods receive the   requestContext bus object as an argument called 'event'.The object is also called 'event',   for the layouts/views.  - Addition of new Application Settings: 	- ReinitPassword: used to protect the fwreinit flag. Usage: fwreinit=password	- onInvalidEvent: write the event to execute when an invalid event is detected, ehGeneral.dspHome	- HandlerCaching: The framework will now cache your event handlers in application scope.	                  Please turn off in development. This is also an intelligent cache. Look at documentation.	- IOCFramework: You can now declare which framework you are using: coldspring or lightwire.           	- IOCDefinitionFile: Here is where you declare the configuration file to load onAppInit in conjunction	  with the IOCFramework declared.- AppMapping setting is now optional, if not set, framework auto calculates.- Deprecation of the AppDevMapping settings.- Addition of Complex Settings to the config.xml for Arrays and Structures	- Arrays use [ ] notation: [1,2,3,4,5]	- Structures use { } notation: {name:luis,country:el salvador,state:california}- Two new implicit methods for event handlers: PreHandler/PostHandler. If you create these methods  in your handlers, then the framework will execute them accordingly.- Addition of an 'alias' property to the Datasource element, this is the alias to your name (dsn).  This is a mandatory property so please update your XML.  <Datasource alias="blog_dsn" name="myblog" dbtype="oracle" />  - Addition of 'getHash()' method to your handlers and plugins. This will retrieve the unique  UUID of the created instance.- Coldbox OCM (Object Cache Manager) : A facility for in-memory caching. This facility caches your  event handlers, plugins, custom plugins and anything you want. Look at API for usage.	- The framework has a reap frequency in which once every cycle,	  the framework will remove objects from the cache that have expired. This way, reaping is	  not performed on every request. A great way to balance cache access and reaping.	  Change in the framework's settings.xml	- Metadata settings for caching for custom plugins and handlers via the cfcomponent tag:	  <cfcomponent name="handler" extends="coldbox.system.eventhandler" cache="true" cachetimeout="500">	  The cachetimeout is in minutes. The cache flag is by default set to true if not set. So if you do not set it 	  explicitly to false, the framework will cache it at the default framework's timeout.	- Cache settings override via config.xml.cfm, please see wiki config guide.- Plugins:     - Beanfactory.cfc - Addition of the populateBean method. It can now populate a named or instantiated                        bean from the request collection. Great for setting a bean with form data.                         It follows the bean contract, thanks to Sanah Ullah    - FileUtilities.cfc - new methods: getJVMFreeMemory(), getJVMTotalMemory(), isCFUUID()    - IOC.cfc - Added Inversion Of Control support via coldspring or lightwire.      Coldspring is the only one supported now. Lightwire will be added in the next version.    - sessionstorage.cfc - New facade plugin to use session scope for permanent values    - renderer.cfc: renderExternalview(). Will render an external view. Any      type of view: js,gif,etc.    - queryHelper.cfc - New plugin to help you sort and filter queries.    - timer.cfc - New plugin to help you time your code.    - New argument to plugin factory: NewInstance it will create a new instance      of the specified plugin.      - New debugging Panel with object Cache Monitor- Tons of bug fixes, look at trac site.- Sample Applications:	- Updated the entire Illidium CFC Generator by Brian Rinaldi. (Pre Flex)	- Galleon Forums updated to version 1.7.008	- ColdBoxReader now moved to a service architecture using ColdSpring and ColdBox new 	  IOC plugin.	- Transfer Sample Application- The framework now supports multi-package handler layout. you can now define packages  for all your handlers due to ColdBox's new event registration system.- The framework now supports for compiled code execution.
