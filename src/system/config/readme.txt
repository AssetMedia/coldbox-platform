You then use the ColdBox framework by including it from the index.cfm, look at the Application template's index file.ex: <cfinclude template="/coldbox/system/coldbox.cfm">This goes also for the extends property of your event handlers too, that needto extend the base eventhandler: coldbox.system.eventhandlerYou can log in to the ColdBox Dashboardby going to your web server and the following address:http://localhost/coldbox/system/admin/index.cfmDefault Password: Coldbox.The readme.txt in the Application Template folder gives you an in depth overviewof how to configure your first ColdBox application.******************************************************************************SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS******************************************************************************- ColdFusion MX 6.X and above- BlueDragon 6.2.1	Please note that the messagebox plugin's render method does not work on BD.	You need to use the renderit() instead. Render is a reserved method in BD.- Application Scope for the Frameworks internal structures & i18N support.- Session Scope for the framework.- Client Scope in order to use the clientstorage and messagebox plugin. (optional)******************************************************************************VERSION CHANGESET CHANGES******************************************************************************Version 0.9.X (June 2006)- Version updated to 0.9.x due to the fact that I had a name change and completerewrite of the app from my TeXtus framework that I developed last year for private use.Version 1.0.0 (July 5, 2006)- First public beta versionVersion 1.0.1 (July 10, 2006)- Fixes for ApplicationStartHandler.Version 1.0.2 (July 2006)- CustomHandler receives the ExceptionBean via the request collection.- Eliminated unused files, code cleanup.- JavaLoader 0.2 plugin integration (Could not wait to release this)- datasourceBean is in place, forgot to include it.Version 1.1.0 (August 2006) CODENAME: JOHN 3:16- Varscoper Checks,Code Optimization and cleanup.- Bug Fixes from 1.0.2- Global Server Installation Method.- CFMX 6.X & BlueDragon are now Supported.- Datasources support via config.xml. You can now use the getDatasource("name") in the  event handlers to retrieve a datsource bean.- Messagebox.render(clearFlag) now has a clearFlag in order to clear or not, the message   structure after rendering.- Eventhandler.cfc code optimization, no longer use of the controller argument and the   call to the super.init with the controller. PLEASE REMOVE THEM, it will speed up your  code and eliminate unecessary references.   All event handlers must change their init method to:  <cffunction name="init" access="public" returntype="any">	  <cfset super.init()>  	  <cfreturn this>  </cffunction> - Renderview can now accept a view name as a parameter. You can then render a view   anywhere you want, layouts, within views, event handlers, etc, and as content variables.- New Plugins: FileWriter & StringBuffer & FileWriter & resourceBundle- Framework/Application extensions via custom plugins.- Coldbox Logging Facilities: ColdBox now provides you with a per application logging facility for errors and custom (error|fatal|information|warning) entries by simplify filling out two settings in your config.xml- Event Handlers now have a "rc" scope available, that is a direct line to the request collection.- New Method: paramValue("var name","default") same as cfparam but for the request collection.- cfcViewer plugin was revised. You can now use it to render documentation with anystylesheet.- New i18n and Resource Bundles Plugins based on Paul Hastings work.- ATTESORO JAVA RESOURCE BUNDLES UTILITY IS INCLUDED.  ******************************************************************************THE DAILY BREAD******************************************************************************"I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but by me"Jn 14:1-12******************************************************************************
