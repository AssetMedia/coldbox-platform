(optional)******************************************************************************VERSION CHANGES******************************************************************************Version 0.9.X (June 2006)- Version updated to 0.9.x due to the fact that I had a name change and completerewrite of the app from my TeXtus framework that I developed last year for private use.Version 1.0.0 (July 5, 2006)- First public beta versionVersion 1.0.1 (July 10, 2006)- Fixes for ApplicationStartHandler.Version 1.0.2 (July 2006)- CustomHandler receives the ExceptionBean via the request collection.- Eliminated unused files, code cleanup.- JavaLoader 0.2 plugin integration (Could not wait to release this)- datasourceBean is in place, forgot to include it.Version 1.1.0 (August 2006)- Varscoper Checks,Code Optimization and cleanup.- Bug Fixes from 1.0.2- Global Server Installation Method.- CFMX 6.X & BlueDragon are now Supported.- Datasources support via config.xml. You can now use the getDatasource("name") in the  event handlers to retrieve a datsource bean.- Messagebox.render(clearFlag) now has a clearFlag in order to clear or not, the message   structure after rendering.- Eventhandler.cfc code optimization, no longer use of the controller argument and the   call to the super.init with the controller. PLEASE REMOVE THEM, it will speed up your  code and eliminate unecessary references.   All event handlers must change their init method to:  <cffunction name="init" access="public" returntype="any">	  <cfset super.init()>  	  <cfreturn this>  </cffunction> - Renderview can now accept a view name as a parameter. You can then render a view   anywhere you want, layouts, within views, event handlers, etc, and as content variables.- New Plugins: FileWriter & StringBuffer- Framework/Application extensions via custom plugins.- Coldbox Logging Facilities: ColdBox now provides you with a per application logging facility for errors and custom (error|fatal|information|warning) entries by simplify filling out two settings in your config.xml- cfcViewer plugin was revised. You can now use it to render documentation with anystylesheet.  ******************************************************************************THE DAILY BREAD******************************************************************************"I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but by me"Jn 14:1-12******************************************************************************
